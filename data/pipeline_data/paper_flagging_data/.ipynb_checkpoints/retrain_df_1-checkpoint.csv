177,"Of note, the LTR16A1 and MIRb integrations were also present, but truncated in the murine Ace2 locus (Fig.1b, c), further supported by LASTz Hs-Mm whole genome alignment (Ensembl Compara databases).To further support the intronic initiation of the chimeric MIRb-Ace2 transcript in species other than humans, we performed RT-qPCR analyses using primers complementary to the respective LTR16A1 and Ace2 exon 10 sequences in the African green monkey, dog, rabbit or mouse genome (Extended Data Fig.3).Whereas all cell lines from these representative species expressed the canonical Ace2 transcript, the MIRb-Ace2 transcript was detected in CV-1, but not Vero cells (both from African green monkey) (Extended Data Fig.3).The MIRb-Ace2 transcript was undetectable in leporine R9ab and murine MCA-38 cells, but was present in canine MDCK cells (Extended Data Fig.3), consistent with the high degree of LTR16A1 and MIRb element conservation in the latter species family.Therefore, MIRb-ACE2 expression in humans likely represents a common mammalian feature that has been lost in some, but not all other mammalian species.To assess the relative expression of ACE2 and MIRb-ACE2 isoforms, we quantified expression of both transcripts across tissue types in the TCGA and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) cohorts.Consistent with recent reports, full-length ACE2 was expressed predominantly in the healthy intestine and kidney and tumors of the same histotypes (Extended Data Fig.4).Expression of MIRb-ACE2 followed a similar overall pattern, but with notable expression also in healthy testis, likely owing to retroelement activation as part of epigenetic reprogramming during spermatogenesis.However, despite similar histotype distribution of ACE2 and MIRb-ACE2 expression, the ratio of the two isoforms was characteristically different between distinct histotypes and tumor types.For example, in larger TCGA patient cohorts, LUAD samples expressed higher levels of ACE2 than of MIRb-ACE2 (mean ACE2/MIRb-ACE2 ratio = 5.63), whereas LUSC samples showed the opposite phenotype with higher expression of MIRb-ACE2 (mean ACE2/MIRb-ACE2 ratio = 0.87) (Fig.2a, b).ACE2 and MIRb-ACE2 expression and their ratios were not affected by patient sex, arguing against a strong effect of the X chromosomal location of ACE2 on either isoform expression (Fig.2a, b).",0,0.8442773

240,"We show the development of broad and sustained immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and found high titers of Spike-binding and virus-neutralizing antibodies were associated with COVID-19 severity.A group of high responders were identified with high, broad, and sustained neutralizing responses, who may represent ideal donors for convalescent plasma donations.Most importantly, although most patients seroconverted, antibodies generated after early infection displayed a significantly reduced antibody binding and neutralization potency to emerging evasive variants.Our data have important implications on hyperimmune therapy, monoclonal antibody treatments, and vaccine development strategies against emerging viral variants.The longevity of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is a fundamental yet currently unresolved question.Like others, we observed a strong correlation between Spike IgG levels and neutralization capacity.Although reports on neutralization prevalence and average titers vary widely depending on sampling and detection assay strategies, our results expand on previous findings by comparing neutralization levels with antigen-specific response over a longer follow-up period with more time points than most previous studies.Early antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 could not be studied as the first sample was collected beyond 2 months after PCR positivity and is a limitation of the study.The decline in IgG titers and neutralization often stabilized at different levels later into convalescence, addressing whether decreasing IgG levels eventually plateau, this was particularly evident in LIFE whose samples were collected later postinfection and with a longer follow-up period than ADAPT.Spike IgM levels decreased more rapidly than IgG, but were still detectable up to 205 days after diagnosis, much later than previously reported and consistent with mathematical modeling of decline of IgM titers in a smaller convalescent cohort.While our results reveal widely different magnitudes of initial responses and a decrease in neutralizing antibodies titers, most patients have detectable Spike IgG and neutralizing responses more than 5 months after diagnosis, suggesting extended humoral protection, even in those with mild manifestations of the disease.IgG and IgM against conformational Spike antibody assays have been seldom used, and Spike IgM detection has been challenging.Although many serological assays have reported 100% sensitivity at approximately 15 days postinfection, prevalence studies, vaccine efficacy, and assessment for convalescent COVID-19 plasma donors may not recruit so early postinfection or postvaccination.In this context, and in future seroprevalence studies, more sensitive antibody assays will be essential despite their comparatively higher costs.Flow cytometry assays are used in clinical diagnostics, mainly in the sensitive and specific detection of neuroimmunological autoantibodies in which antigen conformation and discrimination of seropositive patients from healthy controls are critical.Within the follow-up time, the detection of Nucleocapsid and Spike IgG by high capacity commercial assays was less sensitive compared to the flow cytometry assay.Integration of the flow cytometry assay to detect Spike IgG would be valuable to include in the diagnostic pipeline in addition to resource-intensive whole-virus neutralization.",0,0.8669353

423,"In addition, a recent serosurvey of blood products further suggests early undetected spread in multiple states across the US from December 2019 through January 2020.Of note, these studies relied solely on molecular testing without validation by viral genome sequencing.Our study is complementary to those efforts and provides information regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the diverse, densely populated, international travel hub of NYC, >1 month prior to the detection of the first reported NYS case.Although we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in specimens from late January 2020, without fully reconstructed genomes it is impossible to determine whether these cases seeded the community spread observed in March.Our molecular findings are in agreement with previous evidence of sporadic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US in January 2020, and with evidence from an MSHS SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey that identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity as early as mid-February 2020, consistent with infection at least 2 weeks earlier.Lastly, although our survey only examined RPN specimens collected starting 30 December 2019, the absence of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from early January, in conjunction with the serological evidence, makes the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the US East Coast populace prior to 2020 unlikely.The observation that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified from RPN pools, including specimens collected between the last week of February and the first week of March 2020, cluster within the B.1 lineage is consistent with the phylogenetic analyses by us and others linking most cases during the first wave to an influx of travelers from Europe prior to travel restrictions on mainland European countries (on 13 March 2020) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (on 16 March 2020).Our findings provide further evidence that the limited availability of diagnostic testing early in the epidemic hindered the identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and help explain the expansion of the epidemic notwithstanding travel restrictions designed to limit further introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the US.These observations indicate a brief window of opportunity in which surveillance, testing, and contact tracing of a limited number of infections may have stemmed community spread.Our study has several limitations because the RPN pools were made from available residual diagnostic specimens that varied with respect to duration and conditions of storage.It is, therefore, possible that some positive specimens:particularly those with low viral titers:were missed due to degradation of the viral RNA genomes.Of note, our pools of ten specimens each were prepared prior to the US FDA authorization for pooling up to six for diagnostic testing with the cobas  6800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test.",0,0.89576674
845,"The putative adenosine binding pocket we identified is located ~25 A away at the back of the catalytic pocket (Fig.1).Nsp10 is a 139 amino-acid long zinc-binding protein that stimulates the enzymatic activity of nsp16.We traced all functional regions known for protein-protein and protein-metal binding in nsp10, with the exception of the N-terminal 17 residues that appear to be disordered in our structure, but form an alpha-helix in the binary state (CoV-1 nsp10) in the absence of a cap structure.The N-terminus of this helix runs in the direction of the cap-binding site of nsp16 but locates >20 A away from the catalytic center.Nsp10 adopts a structural fold with two distinct Zn-binding modules, including a gag-knuckle-like fold.Binding of the RNA cap did not induce any major conformational change in nsp10.RNA cap analogue bindingWe compared our ternary structure with bound substrate to that of SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 bound to SAM (PDB ID 3R24), but without substrate.While the cores of the nsp16 and nsp10 proteins remain largely unperturbed (with an RMSD of 1.11 A for 292 Calpha atoms between the prior CoV-1 structure and our own), we found significant deviations in two regions of nsp16 that constitute the substrate-binding pocket.We refer to these regions as gate loop 1 (amino acids 20-40) and gate loop 2 (amino acids 133-143) (Fig.2).The binding of the Cap-0 substrate results in an ~180  outward rotation of gate loops 1 and 2 from their positions in the binary structure displacing them by 7 A and 5.2 A, respectively.The resultant widening of the pocket allows accommodation of the RNA cap substrate, and engages the N7-methyl guanosine base of Cap-0 (me7Go) in a deep groove formed by residues of gate loop 1 on one side and gate loop 2 on the other (Fig.2a, b, d, f, Supplementary Movie 1, Supplementary Fig.4).The loop region immediately downstream of Pro134 that is part of gate loop 2 also flips ~180  in the ternary complex to accommodate the A1 nucleotide of the cap (Fig.2a).Gln28 and Asn29 (gate loop 1) orient outward, whereas the side chain of invariant Tyr30 rotates inward, thereby forming a cleft to stabilize the purine ring of me7Go through a pi-pi stacking interaction (Fig.2d).The opposite face of the me7Go purine ring is stabilized by a H-bond between an oxygen of Glu173 and the positively charged N7 of me7Go.",0,0.8426303
43,"Furthermore, antigenic drift in influenza A/H3N2 has illustrated how some amino acid substitutions can result in little to no escape variants, while some substitutions can create the emergence of new subspecies that have the potential to cause an epidemic.The influenza A/H3N2 stain from 2005 to 2006 showed a single point-mutation at position 31 of the M2 protein, a transmembrane ion channel that equilibrates pH across the viral membrane upon entry into a host cell.This mutation to the M2 protein resulted in a drastic increase in amantadine resistance, from 2 to 12% to greater than 91%, rendering the antiviral inadequate in inhibiting influenza replication.These escape mutants will not be the dominant emerging pandemic strain during each season, but they have the possibility of gaining a single mutation that could escape the host's immune system as well as antiviral treatments and vaccines.The association between antigenic drift and the influenza vaccine design occurs through natural evolution of the virus and the decisions by global public health officials.4.Antigenic Shift in Influenza VirusOne major challenge for the development of influenza vaccines is the persistent alterations in the virus.Antigenic transformation occurs in influenza viruses through two processes, called antigenic drifts and antigenic shifts, which occur in the surface glycoproteins.Both mechanisms help the virus evade host immune responses, which results in complications for vaccination efficacy.Contrary to antigenic drift, which is accompanied by minor gradual changes, an antigenic shift is the exchange of the entire genes that encode HA and/or NA.The segmented nature of the influenza virus genome provides the possibility for gene segment exchange between viruses when a single cell is infected simultaneously with diverse viral particles.In other words, an antigenic shift is the reassortment and presentation of new HA, NA, or both gene segments from different strains of influenza viruses that circulate among humans and animals.Antigenic shift occurs exclusively in IAVs due to their genomic variations across multiple animal species, which serve as the sources of viruses with different antigenicity.On the other hand, influenza B viruses do not undergo antigenic shifts because non-human animal hosts have not been identified for these viruses.Overall, the process of antigenic shift leads to the emergence of novel IAVs in human populations that would have limited immunity and can cause problems in vaccination efficacy as well as elevated transmission, which has the potential to lead to a flu pandemic, as has been the result in the past.5.Cross-Species Transmission of Influenza VirusThe emergence of pandemic influenza virus strains and new seasonal viruses have drawn the attention of scientists to the issue of cross-species transmission.There is a need to advance the understanding of how bird and animal influenza viruses can cross the species barrier and expand their host-range.Prevention of outbreaks of human influenza is dependent on strategies for controlling the disease in birds and animals, which can spread the virus to humans (especially considering the difficulty in obtaining complete protection against the numerous IAV variants).",0,0.8487998

661,"In this section, we briefly review a selection of these for which detailed receptor specificity and structural analyses have been carried out.H6N1 IAV strains circulate primarily in avian species in East Asia, Europe, and North America.To date, just a single confirmed case of H6N1 in humans has been reported, with seroprevalence studies of poultry workers suggesting similarly low rates of exposure, indicative of likely subclinical disease in most cases and thus poor adaptation to human infection.Subsequent receptor-binding and structural analyses comparing the human H6N1 infection strain with circulating avian H6 counterparts from the same period revealed two noncanonical receptor-binding variants: V190 (previously unknown) and S228 (classical H2/H3 humanizing).As expected, avian H6 HAs showed strong alpha2-3 avian-type receptor specificity, while human isolates featured some increased alpha2-6 binding, though at best overall mixed specificity.Interestingly, and in contrast to H5N1 & H7N9, an in vitro receptor-binding evolution study by de Vries et al.demonstrated that complete human-type receptor specificity switching in the human H6 isolate could be achieved by introduction of just a single variant, G225D (associated with H1 pandemic viruses), albeit at an apparent cost to avidity.However, given that G225D is not found to naturally occur in more than 600 H6N1 isolates currently present within the GISAID database (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; www.gisaid.org), and overall apparent low infection potential in humans, H6N1 viruses likely do not pose a major pandemic threat.H9N2 viruses circulate in avian species, particularly poultry, mainly within Russia, China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.Similar to H6N1, human infection with H9N2 most frequently leads to mild disease; however, transmission appears to occur substantially more frequently (approximately 70 confirmed cases recorded since 1999 [https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/, June 2020]), with the majority of cases also appearing in younger people.H9N2 is a large and complex IAV subtype divided into three clades: G1 (Eastern & Western lineages), BJ94, and Y439, with human infections arising from strains present in all three clades, though mostly G1 and BJ94.Early H9N2 viruses largely corresponded to classical avian-type receptor-binding genotypes including E190 and Q226 (H1 and H2/H3 key determinant positions, respectively); however, subsequent and contemporary strains now feature substantial variability, including widespread circulation of humanizing Q226L mutants, particularly within G1 and BJ94 clades.While early studies have suggested that Q226L-bearing H9N2 viruses lead directly to significant binding of human-type receptors, similar to H5 viruses, receptor specificity within H9 is complex.",0,0.80313224

121,"The RBD sequences of different SARS-CoV-2 strains that are circulating globally were initially thought to be conserved; however, with the availability of sequencing data several mutations have been reported.These findings emphasize the argument, that there may be correlation of the mutated strains circulating in a particular geographic setting with higher mortality rates and transmission patterns beside other combating factors.The mutation rate in ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses is intensely high which can be million times higher than that of their hosts and this results in virulence modulation and evolutionary capability for better viral adaptation.Genetic depiction of virus mutations can thus offer valuable insights for assessing the fitness of drug resistance, immune escapism, and pathogenesis.Due to its receptor binding property, the S protein is also supposed to be immunogenic and a putative target for developing the neutralizing antibodies and vaccines.It is reported that single-point mutations in the conserved amino acid residues in the RBD region completely abolishes the capacity of full-length S protein to induce neutralizing antibodies.Thus, virus mutation studies can be crucial for designing new vaccines and antiviral drugs.In this study, we aimed to predict the mutations in the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in the database (whole genome sequences as well as partial coding sequences of spike protein) and analyze the effect of each mutation on the antigenicity of the predicted epitopes.This information may be helpful in predicting the transmission and infectivity of various SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide.Materials and MethodsSelection of SARS-CoV-2 Datasets Entrez Direct (EDirect) utilities were used to access the NCBI's nucleotide database by using in-house developed bash scripts to batch download the data.We used query keyword or phrase as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" and ""spike coding sequences (CDS)"" by applying ESearch and EFetch utilities implemented in bash scripts to download the dataset for genome and spike proteins that were available till May 1, 2020.A total of 1,325 complete draft genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and additional 279 CDS having partial genomes coding spike protein (total 1,604 CDS of spike protein) were downloaded in FASTA format available globally from NCBI database ( Fig.1 ).SARS-COV-2 genome datasets from different countries available on NCBI till May 1, 2020.SARS-COV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Multiple Sequence Alignment and Correlation of Genomic SNPs and Protein Mutations Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all the 1,325 complete genome sequences as well as 1,604 CDS was performed using ClustalW-MPI with default parameters.Generated SNPs were identified by in-house developed bash scripts to batch process the data using Blade Server (Dell PowerEdge FC640 Server) with 256 GB RAM and 40 Core processor with 2.30 GHz.",0,0.675023
135,"Because the small RNA libraries were dominated by host miRNAs and a U [the preferred 5'-terminal nucleotide for Ago loading ] is present at the 5' end of this RNA, we interrogated whether it could represent a viral miRNA-like small RNA.SARS-CoV-2 expresses a small RNA derived from the ORF7a sequence.(A) Viral small RNA reads obtained from the three cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 map to a single distinct peak within the viral genome (data for MOI 5, 24 hpi are shown).The replicates for each cell line were overlayed on a single track (represented by different colors) and are normalized to 107 total reads.(B) The reads coming from SARS-CoV-2 (~20 to 25 nt long) map near the beginning of the ORF7a gene (encoded amino acids are shown above the nucleotide sequence).Data from Calu-3 cells are shown.(C) CoV2-miR-O7a forms a hairpin with the sequence immediately downstream in the ORF7a transcript.Shaded nucleotides indicate the sequences detected by Northern blot probes: orange for 5p and blue for 3p.(D) CoV2-miR-O7a and its precursor can be detected by Northern blotting of extracts from Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.05.(E) As measured by custom TaqMan RT-qPCR, CoV2-miR-O7a is present in nasopharyngeal samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (Right), with its levels correlating with viral load (Left).Since miRNA biogenesis relies on formation of RNA hairpins, we asked whether such an RNA structure could be found within the viral ORF7a sequence.Indeed, the putative viral miRNA together with its downstream region forms a strong hairpin (Fig.2C) whose folding energy is unusually low given the AU-rich nucleotide composition (DeltaG = -19.7 kcal/mol), suggesting that it arose through an evolutionarily driven process.Indeed, the thermodynamic Z-score is -5.5 (meaning that the wild-type sequence is more than 5 SDs more stable than random).In addition, a comprehensive analysis of RNA structural motifs in SARS-CoV-2 found that this hairpin is one of the few (nine) that show evidence of statistically significant sequence covariation:a feature of evolutionary conservation.The formation of the hairpin is also in agreement with previously reported structure probing reactivity datasets, where the only reactive nucleotides occur in loop regions.Since the newly identified small RNA is derived from this hairpin:which is a hallmark of miRNA biogenesis :we named it CoV2-miR-O7a (for SARS-CoV-2 miRNA-like ORF7a-derived small RNA).In addition, there exists sequence and structure similarity of the RNA hairpin between SARS-CoV-2, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a pangolin coronavirus (SI Appendix, Fig.",0,0.73336315
532,"].Applying this analysis to the test group, in which, over the study period, only 2 of 53 subjects became symptomatic, the probability of 2 or fewer subjects becoming symptomatic as a random outcome of only the factors at play among the control group (i.e., the probability of validity of the null hypothesis of no benefit being conferred by the test group's supplementation), would be given by:This analysis of study group results predicts that approximately 733 out of a million trials might produce those results without benefit of an effect of the study-factor.That result being so unlikely, at better than the 0.001 significance level, the study results provide a clear demonstration of a benefit conferred on the test group by supplementation.However, it is possible that some factor other than implementation of supplementation may be contributing to the outcomes.For instance, subjects interested and motivated to implement and maintain compliance with a multi-component supplement regimen, apparently being more health conscious than control group subjects, may indeed actually be healthier, with more robust immune systems more resistant to viral infection.Perhaps also or alternatively, health conscious subjects are more careful about minimizing their exposure to virus-carrying sources and/or about post-exposure disinfection.An approach to compensating in the analyzes for such possible confounding factors may be to assign a lower supplementation-ignoring post-exposure symptom-presentation rate to the test group than that exhibited by the control group, with the difference between the control group's actual experienced post-exposure symptom-presentation rate and the test group's new lowball assigned rate ""absorbing"" effects of the putative confounding factors.A) If the test group is considered to enjoy only three-quarters the control group's demonstrated post-exposure symptom-presentation rate of 0.20, then, for the test group, q = 1-p = 1-(3/4)0.20 = 1-0.15 = 0.85 and the binomial expansion gives:Analyzes were conducted for 3 scenarios of such low test-group post-exposure symptom-presentation rates: B) If the test group's post-exposure infection rate is taken to be only five-eighths the control group's 0.20, then, for the test group, q = 1-p = 1-0.125 = 0.875; and the binomial expansion gives 0.0310, no longer at the 0.01 significance level, but still at a respectable 0.05 significance level.C) If the test group's post-exposure infection rate is taken to be only one-half the control group's 0.20, then, for the test group, q = 1-p = 1-0.10 = 0.90; and the binomial expansion gives 0.0898, no longer at the 0.05 significance level, but only at the 0.1 significance level, at which the null hypothesis of ""zero study-factor effect"" presents a 10% risk of being correct and the null hypothesis, while not strongly confirmed, cannot be rejected.Without further information as to actual exposure-experience of subjects, one could not attach statistical significance to the test group experience if assuming scenario C's post-exposure symptom-presentation rate of 10%.",0,0.85646665
185,"LTR and non-LTR retroelements represent an abundant source of promoters, enhancers, and polyadenylation sequences that can modulate the expression and structure of neighboring genes, as with ACE2.For instance, retroelements serve as promoters or enhancers for a number of ISGs, conferring IFN inducibility, exemplified in the case of AIM2 .Retroelements may further modify the function of ISGs and we have recently described a novel isoform of the ISG CD274 (encoding PD-L1) that produces a truncated form through retroelement exonization.The use of the intronic MIRb and LTR16A1 elements as the promoter and alternative exon for the MIRb-ACE2 isoform explains its independent regulation from that of the full-length ACE2 isoform.In addition to IFN inducibility, the cryptic MIRb-LTR16A1 promoter also confers tissue-specific expression, with the highest levels seen in the upper aerodigestive tract, where it can be the predominant isoform.In contrast, the canonical ACE2 isoform far exceeds expression of the MIRb-ACE2 isoform in the lower gastrointestinal tract.It is theoretically possible that the balance of MIRb-ACE2 and full-length ACE2 isoforms plays a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the upper aerodigestive tract, or that RNA or protein products of MIRb-ACE2 are involved in other pathological or physiological processes.However, the low stability of the MIRb-ACE2 protein product argues that this is unlikely.Independently of any functional significance, expression of the MIRb-ACE2 isoform needs to be carefully considered in studies examining ACE2 regulation at the transcriptional level.The description of this novel isoform highlights the need to validate single-cell RNA-seq data with orthogonal approaches.While single-cell RNA-seq initiatives are an invaluable resource and allow for rapid identification of cell types that express a gene of interest, coverage and read depth are largely insufficient to distinguish between isoforms.Technological advances to improve sequencing depth and bioinformatic tools to impute missing values are rapidly progressing; in the meantime, long-read sequencing techniques to quantify transcript isoforms and confirmation of protein expression levels can be incorporated into existing workflows.This work established MIRb-ACE2 as the predominantly induced form of ACE2 following viral infection or recombinant interferon treatment, including in the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung.The suggestion that ACE2 is an ISG raised fears that therapeutic interferon could be detrimental; however, we find that full-length ACE2 is not increased at the mRNA or protein level.The predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein product could be detected in vitro, albeit under high levels of MIRb-ACE2 RNA expression, and it remains possible that the MIRb-ACE2 protein, or fragments thereof, are produced under certain conditions in vivo.",0,0.7648155
846,"Gln28 and Asn29 (gate loop 1) orient outward, whereas the side chain of invariant Tyr30 rotates inward, thereby forming a cleft to stabilize the purine ring of me7Go through a pi-pi stacking interaction (Fig.2d).The opposite face of the me7Go purine ring is stabilized by a H-bond between an oxygen of Glu173 and the positively charged N7 of me7Go.The methyl group of me7Go is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Cys25 (gate loop 1) and Ser 202 from the loop connecting the beta8 and beta9 strands (Fig.2b, d).These specific interactions with the positively charged N7 and the methyl moiety of the me7Go may confer substrate selectivity against the uncharged GopppA.In gate loop 2, Asn138 rotates outward and the side chain of the invariant Lys137 rotates ~180  inward and forms stabilizing electrostatic interactions with all 3 phosphates of the Cap-0 structure and the 3'-O of the me7Go ribose.Tyr30 and Lys137 form a partial enclosure to restrict the movement of the terminal residue (me7Go) of the RNA cap (Fig.2b, d, Supplementary Movie 1).Gate loop 1 runs perpendicular to the purine ring of me7Go such that the backbone amide of Leu27 forms a hydrogen bond with O6 of me7Go to confer specificity for guanine.The ribose sugar of me7Go is sandwiched by the sidechains of Lys137 and His174 in gate loop 2 (Fig.2b, d).The three phosphates of me7GopppA1 are stabilized through H-bonds with residues located in the loop regions emanating from the beta6 (Tyr132, Lys137), beta7 (Thr172 and His174), and beta8 (Ser 201 and Ser 202) strands (Fig.2d, Supplementary Fig.4).By comparing our structure with those for the 2'O MTases of Dengue (PDB ID: 5DT0) and Vaccinia (PDB ID: 1AV6) viruses, we note that only one aromatic residue (Tyr30 in SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 and Phe25 in dengue virus NS5) makes the stacking interaction with the me7Go of the RNA cap.In contrast, two aromatic residues (Tyr22, Phe180) intercalate the me7Go of RNA cap in VP39 of vaccinia virus (PDB ID: 1AV6).Also, the distance between N1 and me7Go bases remains unchanged (~10 A), and the SAM/SAH and N1 in all three structures overlay well in three structures.However, the terminal me7Go base of CoV-2 RNA cap rotates ~180  around the gamma-phosphate (compared to Dengue virus) to assume a radically different orientation, suggesting a diverse geometric arrangement of the RNA cap in RNA/DNA viruses (Supplementary Fig.2e).",0,0.7029373

231,"However, donors with more than 10 donations (n = 30) had decay profiles similar to the whole cohort, in which donors stabilized at mid-low level, and none of these highly recurrent donors became seronegative (S2 Fig).Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with Spike antibody levels and is maintained over timeThe neutralization capacity of these individual responses was assessed on a Spike-driven virus-cell fusion assay and a whole-virus neutralization assay (Fig 1A).Most sera were capable of inhibiting virus-cell fusion (82%, 68/83 ADAPT; 68%, 104/152 LIFE) and mediating viral neutralization (88%, 73/83 ADAPT; 94%, 143/152 LIFE) (Fig 2A, Table 2).In both cohorts, the virus-cell fusion assay was more stringent than the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay as a proportion of individual sera with lower titers in the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay were negative in the virus-cell fusion assay (7%, 6/83 ADAPT; 27%, 41/152 LIFE), and most individuals had higher titers in the neutralization assay (Fig 2A).To understand the discrepancy between both viral assays, live SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were enumerated and directly compared to Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles.Cell-permeable RNA-specific staining of live virions detected viral particles that were Nucleocapsid positive (Fig 2B).The particle to transduction ratios from the fusion assay were 1.03 x 105, consistent with the low specific infectivity of lentiviruses such as HIV-1.In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 particle to infectivity ranged from 58 (HekAT14) to 578 (VeroE6), consistent with the ratio reported for influenza virus.However, the absolute viral particle number was 74-fold higher in Spike-pseudotyped particle preparation (1.64 x 108 particles per ml) compared to authentic SARS-CoV-2 (2.22 x 106 particles per ml).Thus, the specific infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that of Spike-expressing lentiviral particles, which may account for the higher sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2-based neutralization assay.Viral neutralization and inhibition of viral-cell fusion are strongly correlated with Spike antibody titers and sustained overtime.(A) 68%-82% of convalescent sera inhibited virus-cell fusion, whereas 88%-94% sera neutralized live authentic SARS-CoV-2.Neutralization titers were higher than viral-cell fusion titers in ADAPT (ns, not significant) and LIFE (P < 0.0001).(B) Approximately 75% of virus particles were SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid- and RNA positive (overlay, yellow).(C) All but one ADAPT patient had stable responses over time, whereas most LIFE donors (82%) had a decreased virus-cell fusion over time, with the majority (71%) exhibiting a single-phase decay.(D) In sera capable of viral neutralization, most ADAPT sera were stable (89%), whereas most LIFE sera (56%) had a decreased score over time, with the majority (75%) exhibiting a single-phase decay.",0,0.60111415

442,"According to previous reports, the more the host cell proteases able to process the coronavirus S protein, the more acceleration in viral tropism observed.Apart from that, this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321096) which is a well-reported protease to cleave at S1/S2 of S glycoprotein.Comparative analyses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein showed 77% similarity between them where the most diverse region was the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain.The insertion of 17 additional amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 and its high sequence diversity suggests that it may have a role in binding with other cell receptors in humans.This is because the N-terminal domain could function as the receptor-binding domain of various coronaviruses.A similar phenomenon has been observed in mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) where the NTD is reported to attach with the host entry receptor.The spatial distribution of variations in amino acid sequences of S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 showed that 17 variations out of 26 were found among the sequences deposited from the US.But there were 7 unique variations found among the sequences from 5 countries (from 4 continents namely Australia, Europe, Latin America, and Asia) out of 6 sequences available during the study period (Fig.5).Although the number of sequences analyzed herein is too small to speculate the exact trend of S glycoprotein evolution, these variants might play a vital role in adaptation to a new geospatial environment.The variation analyses in amino acids indicated the structural features of different domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.The variations have multiple effects on the structure resulting in change in stability, favoring various interactions, and conformational diversity.Augmented infection kinetics and viral spreading may have an association with the structural changes and composition of residues in the viral spike protein.However, to identify the actual role of involvement of S glycoprotein, a larger dataset regarding genomics and proteomics of SARS-CoV-2 is required as this protein is vital to understand the viral pathogenicity, evolution and development of therapeutics.Further analyses of all the S glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 genomes with different epidemiological aspects are warranted to get a better understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.Credit author statementSyed Mohammad Lokman: Visualization; Formal analysis; Data curation; Writing - draft.Md.Rasheduzzaman: Investigation; Formal analysis; Writing - draft.Asma Salauddin: Investigation; Formal analysis.Rocktim Barua: Investigation; Visualization.Afsana Yeasmin Tanzina: Formal analysis; Writing - draft.Meheadi Hasan Rumi: Investigation; Visualization.Md.",0,0.8314936

586,"noted unique features on a separate (N-terminal) domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins that may confer binding to alternative host-cell receptors.Alternative host cell interactions by these N-terminal domains warrant consideration, as it is known that analogous domains on several human CoVs have important auxiliary cell-binding functions.SARS-CoV-2 S proteins have also acquired several basic residues (RRAR/S), forming a furin protease cleavage site.Temporal progression of proteolytic scissions prime and then activate SARS-CoV S proteins to catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion.Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 furin substrate site is likely to facilitate the priming cleavage step, which sensitizes S proteins to the subsequent activating cleavages occurring on susceptible target cells, and facilitates virus entry and infection, as depicted in Figure 1.Consequently, the hypothesis that heightened protease sensitivities account, in part, for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and disease certainly merits further exploration.Quarantine measures are in place to limit the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, but the risk of a global pandemic is real.The development of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs is a priority to reduce the burden of this virus.An immediate challenge is to construct SARS-CoV-2 S-based vaccines that display conserved epitopes and elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies as well as virus-specific T cell responses.Similar daunting tasks lie ahead in identifying safe and effective drugs that suppress SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication and in making recommendations for their clinical use.If given too late, they may not modify the disease course, even if virus loads are diminished.Committed research communities can and will build from the foundational knowledge that is now in place and respond appropriately to these challenges.ReferencesA pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat originSARS-like WIV1-CoV poised for human emergenceA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patientsReceptor and viral determinants of SARS-coronavirus adaptation to human ACE2Receptor recognition by novel coronavirus from Wuhan: an analysis based on decade-long structural studies of SARSCryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformationStructures of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein in complex with sialoside attachment receptorsActivation of the SARS coronavirus spike protein via sequential proteolytic cleavage at two distinct sitesProtease inhibitors targeting coronavirus and filovirus entry",0,0.78598374

The NMR manufacturer recommendation for IVDr analyses requires samples to undergo one freeze-thaw cycle, therefore samples that had undergone a single freeze-thaw (FT1) were used as the standard comparator.Effects of storage on the stability of samples at refrigerated temperature (4  C).Serum samples from five participants were analyzed within 1 h after processing (t = 0) and an aliquot of each sample was stored at 4  C for 5 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 and 168 h. Freshly measured samples at t = 0 were used as a reference point for directionality of changes.Effects of storage on the stability of samples at room temperature (20  C).Serum samples from five participants were analyzed within 1 h after processing (t = 0) and were compared to an aliquot of each sample which was stored at 20  C for 24 h and 48 h.Effects of storage with added buffer at refrigerated temperature (5 C).Serum samples from five participants were analyzed within 1 h after processing (t = 0) and the NMR tubes were stored at 5  C for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h. The NMR tubes were held in an NMR SampleJet (a refrigerated autosampler mounted on top of the NMR spectrometer) in between measurements.Effect of different collection tubes on blood sample composition.Blood from each of the five participants was collected into seven different types of blood collection tubes.Serum samples were obtained using 10 mL silica sprayed collection tubes (BD 367895, red top) and 5 mL SST II Advance gel tubes (BD 367954, yellow top).Plasma samples were obtained using Lithium Heparin and EDTA collection tubes.For Lithium Heparin tubes, this included 6 mL spray coated (BD 367885, green top) and 4.5 mL PST II tubes (BD 367375, pale green top) whereas for EDTA collection tubes, 2 mL liquid K3EDTA (BD 367836, lavender top), and two different sizes of spray coated K2EDTA tubes (BD 367525 for 10 mL and BD 367839 for 4 mL, purple top) were used.",0,0.8776369

728,"Open access to PDB structures of remdesivir bound to the RdRp sets the stage for structure-guided discovery of second generation nucleoside analogs with superior potency and/or selectivity, more desirable drug-like properties, or better Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion profiles (e.g., improved oral bioavailability to avoid intravenous administration).Open access to our computed 3D structural models of 840 RdRp USVs will provide useful information that may enable drug hunting teams to anticipate potential sources of drug resistance during selection for candidates slated for in vitro pre-clinical development studies.Open access to PDB structures of other essential SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (and those of their closely related SARS-CoV-1 homologs) have already facilitated initiation of structure-guided drug discovery campaigns for PLPro, nsp5, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp10/nsp16.As for RdRp, free availability of computed 3D structural models of nearly 1500 USVs may provide useful information pertaining to potential causes of drug resistance.Knowledge of sequence (and 3D structure) variation during the pandemic could also be used to prioritize these potential drug targets using quantitative assessments of active site conservation.The best drug discovery targets could be those proteins observed to undergo the fewest amino acid changes in their active (or drug-binding) site during the first 6 months of the pandemic.It is also possible that inhibitors making contacts with residues that are not engaged by substrates will be more susceptible to the emergence of drug resistance.The S-protein is the target of both monoclonal antibodies (for passive immunization) and vaccines.At the time of writing, several monoclonal antibodies had already received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US FDA (e.g., bamlanivimab; sponsor company Eli Lilly and Co.).The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine had received full FDA approval and the Moderna mRNA vaccine was granted under EUA.Open access to a host of PDB structures of the S-protein in various conformational states and in complexes with host cell proteins and Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies will facilitate the work of research teams focused on discovery and development of second-generation monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.Free availability of 689 3D structural models of S-protein USVs may provide insights into potential efficacy failures due to amino acid changes in the S-protein that interfere with viral antigen recognition by antibodies (monoclonal or humoral) or T-cells while preserving ACE2 receptor binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSProject historyThis work was initiated by research interns (undergraduates and one high school student) hosted virtually during the summer of 2020 by the Rutgers University Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine (IQB), the Rutgers University RISE Program, and the US-funded RCSB Protein Data Bank headquartered at Rutgers.Prior to the online five-week research program, participating students and mentors received 1 week of online training in 3D molecular visualization and computational bioinformatics in the IQB ""Summer of the Coronaverse"" Online Boot Camp.The methods used in the research study were developed, evaluated, and refined during the online Boot Camp.Supervision of the research phase was provided by IQB graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and RCSB Protein Data Bank scientific staff, all of whom served as mentors in the Boot Camp.",0,0.81015897

885,"Interestingly, pangolins have lost IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1) and ZBP1 (Z-DNA binding protein 1) genes during evolutionary divergence.IFIH1 and ZBP1 proteins are intracellular sensors of exogeneous RNAs able to activate cellular and organismal responses, such as necroptotic cell death, interferon signaling and inflammation.It is possible that the loss of the IFIH1 and ZBP1 genes provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing the inflammation-induced damage to the host tissues and thus contributed to the transition from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins.This hypothesis, if confirmed, could be the basis of the phenomenon of viral accommodation in some species.However, although there are indications of the role that the pangolin could play in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, there is no direct evidence (experimental infection) that this animal is the intermediate host of the virus.The virus was fairly stable (without significant mutation) until 01/12/2020, and spread through human contact, and not from its inherent abilities for rapid growth and continuous evolution.Although 230,000 viral genomic sequences of hCoV-19 have been submitted and shared in GISAID, few mutations of any clinical significance have been identified thus far.A missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, predominant in Europe (954 of 1449 (66%) sequences) which is now spreading worldwide (1237 of 2795 (44%) sequences), seems to cause a higher infection rates in vitro.However, the lack of detailed clinical data suggests that probably this mutation is neutral.Recently, a novel recurrent mutation has been identified in Singapore and other countries,  382 variant, that seems to be associated with a milder infection.Many other mutations have been identified and described, but none of these to date are associated with increased viral transmission.It is possible that the recurrent mutations identified are induced by host immunity through RNA modification mechanisms and probably tend to be selectively neutral, with no or negligible effects on the transmissibility of the virus.Paradoxically, it could be argued that SARS-CoV-2's low genetic diversity results in an advantage for mass vaccine immunization.The hostThe vast majority of infections are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, while deaths account for < 1% of infected cases.We know for certain that age is a risk factor:the death rate from COVID-19 soars for patients over the age of 60.This is true of many infections and generally is related to a deficiency in the immune system and pre-existing health conditions.Children are less prone to develop severe COVID-19.These differences are certainly attributable to the genetic diversity of the host.",1,0.6587407
706,"These three cleavage events liberate nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3.The PLPro portion of nsp3 is also implicated in cleaving post-translational modifications of ubiquitin (Ub) and ISG15 domains of host proteins as an evasion mechanism against host antiviral immune responses.PLPro is a cytoplasmic cysteine endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.69) that catalyzes cleavage of the peptide bond C-terminal to LXGG motifs (where X is any amino acid) in the viral polyproteins.This enzyme also recognizes conserved LRGG motifs found within the C-terminal segments of Ub and ISG15 proteins.According to the MEROPS classification, PLPro belongs to the peptidase clan CA (family C16), containing a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (C111-H272-D286).The first structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLPro to be made public (PDB ID 6W9C) revealed a symmetric homotrimer with each enzyme monomer being highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 PLPro (PDB ID 2FE8; r.m.s.d.~ 0.8 A, sequence identity~83%).Since PDB release of this initial SARS-CoV-2 PLPro structure, additional co-crystal structures of PLPro with a variety of ligands have been deposited to the PDB (list updated weekly at http://rcsb.org/covid19).In many of these structures, the enzyme is monomeric, indicating that the trimer observed in PDB ID 6W9C is almost certainly a crystal packing artifact.Comparison of the various PLPro monomer structures reveals that the enzyme does not undergo large conformational changes upon binding of inhibitors or (protein) substrates (Figure 6A).We, therefore, used the structure of an inhibited form of the enzyme (PDB ID 6WUU) for evolutionary analyses of PLPro (Figure 6A).(A) Space-filling representation of the experimental structure of the PLPro monomer (blue) bound to a covalent inhibitor (Vir250; red/pink) (PDB ID 6WUU).(B) Ribbon/atomic stick figure representation of the PLPro-ISG15 interface (PDB ID 6YVA).Oxygen atoms are shown in red, nitrogens in blue, and sulfurs in yellow.Cartoons and carbons are gray for ISG15, purple for substituted PLPro interfacial residues, and cyan for all other PLPro residues.",1,0.6309379
234,"P values in LIFE hospitalized patients (C) were not calculated due to low sample size.COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.Patients had broader responses across the spectrum of severity in ADAPT (Fig 3B).ADAPT and LIFE hospitalized patients with more severe symptoms were more likely to exhibit a broader antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, i.e., polyreactive toward the 3 antigens (Fig 3B).Interestingly, 2 of 7 hospitalized LIFE patients who had a short 24-hour hospitalization harbored non-broad responses, and Spike-only responses were exclusively observed in nonhospitalized, mild, and moderate individuals (Fig 3B).Higher IgG titers against Membrane and Nucleocapsid proteins were also associated with disease severity in both cohorts (Fig 3C).Patients with broader SARS-CoV-2 responses and higher disease severity had greater viral neutralization and virus-cell fusion inhibition (Fig 3D and 3E).This polyreactive, high severity subgroup was populated almost exclusively by older males (Fig 3F).Similarly, higher neutralization and virus-cell fusion inhibition titers were more enriched in older males with moderate disease and who were hospitalized (Fig 3G and 3H).High responders with strong and broad SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are rare and could be ideal plasma donorsA small subgroup of individuals were ""high responders"" characterized by high Spike IgG, Spike IgM positive, broad polyantigenic immunoreactivity (binding to Nucleocapsid, Spike, and Membrane), virus-cell fusion inhibition (>1:160), and neutralization (>1:320).They maintained this high response over time (n = 14, 17% ADAPT, n = 19, 12% LIFE).High responders were more likely to be male, hospitalized, and were of older age (Fig 4A).Further characterization was performed on a series of increasingly permissive cell lines: VeroE6, HekAT14, HekAT10, and HekAT24 (Fig 4B, S3 Fig).Low, i.e., non-high responders, and high responders sera neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6, HekAT14, and HekAT10 cell lines, whereas limited neutralization was observed in the hyperpermissive HekAT24 cell line (Fig 4B).Using the HekAT24 cell line, 2 elite responders were identified in LIFE (Fig 4C), with high Spike IgG and IgM levels, and neutralization titers 30- to 4-fold greater than other individuals (Fig 4D).Interestingly, elite responders had the highest detectable IgM levels, and early IgM decay coincided with a decrease in neutralization titers, whereas Spike IgG remained stable overtime (Fig 4E).",1,0.86377805
224,"Immunoreactivity to other abundant antigens, such as Membrane or Envelope, is unknown.Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for antibodies that bind to Spike, a large homotrimeric glycoprotein studded across the viral surface, whereas Membrane and Envelope proteins, although exposed on the viral surface, remain to be identified as neutralizing antibody targets.Rapid development of neutralizing antibody response to Spike correlates with viral immunity, and individuals who seroconvert may develop a lasting neutralization response.The SARS-CoV-2 virus has accumulated many polymorphisms across its genome, especially within the Spike gene.Shortly after the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population, many early and dominant amino acid polymorphisms were associated with viral entry fitness, such as D614G.However, the pressure of the neutralizing antibody response might select for escape mutations in Spike that limit postinfectious immunity or vaccine protection.One example is the S477N/D614G Spike variant, which appeared in Australia during July and August 2020, was traced to a single event from Australian hotel quarantine, and represented greater than 58% in Oceania.More recently, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) appeared primarily in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and Brazil (B.1.1.28.1 and B.1.1.28.2, recently renamed P1 and P2, respectively), and VOC B.1.1.7 is currently becoming the most dominant worldwide.Using the lessons learned from research of other viral pathogens and neuroimmunological autoantibodies, we have developed a suite of novel high-content assays that sensitively assess antibody responses against the native oligomeric structure of Spike and its emerging variants.To measure the neutralizing capacity, we have also developed a Biosafety Level 2 surrogate Spike-driven virus-cell fusion assay that has been cross-validated with a novel high-content, machine-scored, Biosafety Level 3 authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay.Herein, we characterize the longevity, polyantigenic breadth, and neutralization capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in individuals and their responses to globally emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.Using 2 longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 community- and hospital-based Australian cohorts representative of the broad spectrum of disease severity at acute infection, we showed that the polyantigenic and neutralizing responses to SARS-CoV-2 are sustained, associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and are evaded by emerging viral variants.This work provides a community snapshot of humoral immunity in those recovering from infection and sheds light on important considerations for vaccine design and selection of donors for convalescent plasma therapy.",1,0.7786535
749,"At last, with taking the analysis output from all servers applied in this study we draw an inference that what makes the D614G meaningful for the COVID-19 pandemic still unclear and agrees with a previous study; this is due to many reasons.First, a current lack of clinical metadata to link the viral mutations with viral phenotype.Second, lack of fair sample demographic distribution and last, lack of association between viral genomic data with the symptoms degree of severity.ConclusionMutations and amino acid variants analysis are essential in understanding the mechanism of binding of spike protein with its receptor to have insights on possibilities to design a peptide or nucleotide-based vaccine for COVID-19.This study predicted the three-dimensional monomer structure of the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 of Jordanian specimens.Here, we also reported four amino acid variants.However, the highest mutation frequency in our study, with 62% of samples, showed aspartate substitution to glycine at D614G is consistent with other reports for samples collected in Europe at the same time of our sample collection, in March 2020.In this study, the mutation D614G was the dominant local mutation in Jordan.We expected that the four reported amino acid variants, especially tyrosine deletion at Y144 located in the SARS-CoV-like_Spike_S1_NTD and the aspartate substitution to glycine at D614G located in the SARS-CoV-2_Spike_S1_RBD to have an expliciteffect on the function of the spike protein in the Jordanian population collectively.However, D614G might change the viral conformational plasticity and hence a potential viral fitness gain.These mutations are most likely low to neutral in their effect when looking primarily at the mutation analysis by the Phyre2, were tall red bars represent the highest favorable residues to have a phenotypic effect than shorter blue bars.Still, no tall red bars were noticed at all.It is highly recommended to keep monitoring the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Jordan on a monthly bases with a higher number of samples to fulfill a statistical power.Some of the low percentages appeared mutations, e.g., 5% might increase if the population size is larger so, in general, one must be cautious about drawing any concrete conclusions about the symptoms severity and viral transmission from genome sequences only.Altered glycosylation at the G614 was not considered in this study, but it could be a motivation in future studies.Funding""This research received no external funding.""Author contributionsWalid Al-Zyoud & Hazem Haddad have contributed equally to Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Data curation, Writing- Original draft preparation.Visualization, Investigation: Supervision, Software, Validation.Writing Reviewing and Editing.",1,0.82363725
554,"Mutations that provide a beneficial advantage are more likely to be fixed in the genome.Under this scenario, the distributions of mutations in the viral genome are not random.Instead, mutations accumulate to higher than random frequencies in areas of the genome that contribute to fitness by enhancing stability, transmission, replication efficiency, escape from immunity, suppression of immunity responses, or a combination.The collective results of these effects may be evident through biological properties such as host adaptation, pathogenicity, or others.The emergence of new species, such as SARS-CoV-2, and the rapid emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains are an indication that beta-CoVs evolve quickly and have a high capacity to switch hosts and to adapt to new hosts.Results described here show that beta-CoVs are more variable than polioviruses.In some species, variation is close to that observed for HIV-1 (Fig.5 and 6).The wide host range observed across species suggests that, in beta-CoVs, genomic variation is related to the genetic diversity of the host.While mutations accumulate in the entire genome, they are not randomly or equally distributed.Instead, preferential accumulation of mutations in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all members of the genus Betacoronavirus (Fig.5B).This was particularly evident in SARS-CoV-2.Strains identified to date and isolates from early and middle 2020 can be distinguished based on the S glycoprotein sequence alone (Fig.3).In HIV-1, glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 are the most variable in the genome (Fig.6).Both beta-CoV S glycoprotein and HIV gp120 and gp41 are envelope proteins and mediate viral entry.The S glycoprotein binds to the ACE2 receptor, while gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor.Both the S glycoprotein and gp120 induced the formation of neutralizing antibodies.These features suggest several mechanisms driving diversifying selection in envelope glycoproteins: cellular receptors, entry cofactors, and antibodies.Within the variety of coronavirus hosts, the cellular receptors, entry cofactors, and cellular proteases that process the S1/S2 cleavage site and immunity responses are likely diverse.Results described here show that, for beta-CoVs, the S glycoprotein is variable and mutationally robust and contains intrinsically disordered areas (Fig.4, 5B, and).Disordered proteins allow functionality with a diverse set of interaction partners.These observations are consistent with a model in which host diversity pushes diversifying selection in the S glycoprotein.",1,0.8362951

724,"If and how these may affect RNA-binding remains to be investigated.Structural protein ion channel envelope protein (E-protein)The integral membrane E-protein is the smallest of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (75 residues).It plays important roles in virus-like particle production and maturation.Coronavirus E-proteins are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to Golgi complexes.Although it is abundantly expressed within the cell, only a modest number of copies are incorporated into the viral envelope (estimated number/virion~20 for SARS-CoV-1,).Instead, most of the protein participates in virion assembly and budding together with the SARS-CoV-2 integral membrane M-protein (also a virion structural protein).Additional functions of the E-protein are thought to include preventing M-protein aggregation and inducing membrane curvature.Recombinant coronaviruses lacking E-proteins display weakened maturation, reduced viral titers, or yield incompetent progeny, highlighting its role in maintaining virion integrity.The E-protein consists of a shorter hydrophilic N-terminal segment, a longer hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD), and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain.An amphipathic -helix within the TMD oligomerizes into an homopentameric arrangement perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer forming an ion-conducting viroporin.Residues lining the pore include N15, L19, A22, F26, T30, I33, and L37.The NMR structure of the SARS-CoV-1 E-protein (PDB ID 5X29) served as the template for generating the computed structural model of the SARS-CoV-2 E-protein that was used for analyzing its evolution in 3D (Figure 13).The N-terminal seven residues and the C-terminal ten residues were omitted from the homology model, because they were not reported in the SARS-CoV-1 NMR structure.(A) Space-filling representation of the computed structural model of the E-protein with individual protomers shown with shades of pink and purple.(B) Ribbon representation with each protomer shown using a different color viewed parallel to the membrane (left, membrane shown, N- and C-termini labeled) and down the five-fold axis from the virion surface (right).(C) Pore-lining substitutions L37R and L37H compared to L37 in the reference sequence (residue 37 is shown in a color-coded space-filling representation; C-gray; O-red; N-blue)Overall substitution trends for the E-protein and energetics analysis results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.S68F (nonconservative, structural location unknown) is the most common USV, observed 107 times in the GISAID dataset.",1,0.64753705

182,"In independently reported findings, endogenously produced MIRb-ACE2 protein could not be detected by Western blotting using the same polyclonal anti-ACE2 serum (ab15348).However, a Myc-DDK-tagged or GFP-tagged MIRb-ACE2 protein product was detected following overexpression in T24 cells in the same study.Moreover, a separate study reported detection of the putative MIRb-ACE2 protein in primary nasal epithelial cells by Western blotting using the same polyclonal anti-ACE2 serum (ab15348), raising the possibility that the protein can indeed be translated.To explain the apparent inefficiency of protein production from MIRb-ACE2 transcripts, we cloned the coding sequences of both isoforms into the pcDNA3.1-DYK-P2A-GFP expression vector, which adds both a FLAG tag and P2A peptide-linked GFP as part of the protein product.Expression of GFP was comparable in ACE2-transfected and MIRb-ACE2-transfected cells, suggesting that the single RNA molecule that encodes for both the FLAG-tagged MIRb-ACE2 product and GFP is stable and translated (Fig.5a).Despite that, following transfection with plasmid concentrations producing readily detectable full-length ACE2 and resulting in MIRb-ACE2 RNA levels comparable with those endogenously produced in IFNalpha-stimulated cells, we could not detect the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein with antibodies to the FLAG tag (Fig.5b).However, the FLAG tagged MIRb-ACE2 protein could be detected in HEK293T cells transfected with much higher plasmid concentrations, resulting in RNA expression levels which were one order of magnitude higher than those observed in IFNalpha-stimulated NHBE, SCC-4 or SCC2-25 cells (Fig.5c).Therefore, although the MIRb-ACE2 transcript is efficiently translated (supported by the levels of P2A-linked GFP), the MIRb-ACE2 protein product is much less abundant than the full-length ACE2 at a given RNA transcription level, suggesting post-translational protein instability of the former.Lysine residues 625 and 702 in the full-length ACE2 protein have been described to be ubiquitinated and may contribute to its proteosomal degradation.We generated a K625R K702R (K2R) mutant of full-length ACE2, which increased protein levels, compared to the wild-type ACE2 (Fig.5d).We have introduced the same mutations in the corresponding residues of the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein product, K279R K356R, which were similarly accessible for ubiquitination (Extended Data Fig.8).However, we were unable to detect stable protein following transfection with the MIRb-ACE2 K2R-encoding mutant (Fig.5d).",1,0.6109176

657,"One significant example of this is found in H7N9, where, in recent (particularly fourth and fifth) waves, human isolates of avian viral infections have been found to be highly dominant for the Q226L mutation associated with ""humanized"" receptor specificity in both H2N2 and H3N2 pandemics.However, various studies working both in vitro and in vivo have now demonstrated that the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission, measured by proxy either through airborne infections in the ferret model or through conversion to human receptor specificity on glycan microarrays, is likely both complex and individual to different subtypes, requiring distinct combinations of multiple different adaptive mutations.In this section, we review current knowledge on likely adaptations to support human transmission in prominent avian virus subtypes, as well as evidence for potential selection in nature.H5N1Current H5N1 strains emerged in avian species in China in the mid-1990s and are both highly contagious and extremely pathogenic in birds.Initial human H5N1 cases were detected in 1997, and WHO now reports over 860 documented human H5N1 infections between 2003 and 2019, with a mortality rate of approximately 50% (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/, June 2020), leading to heightened concern about a potential pandemic (by comparison, 1918 pandemic H1N1 estimated case mortality is only approximately 10%).Fortunately, however, most human H5N1 infections to date have been associated with acute exposure to live poultry, and zoonotic strains have shown very limited adaptation for human receptor binding or human-to-human transmission, despite persistent low-frequency introductions for more than two decades.Potential for an H5 pandemic has thus prompted great research into circulating viral mutants that might confer human adaptation, particularly within HA.To date, natural variants with potential to alter receptor specificity have been reported at more than 20 individual H5 amino acid positions, with many more combinations of both natural and engineered mutants also studied (reviewed in detail in ref.).Thus far, however, no naturally occurring H5N1 viruses (whether human or avian isolates) have demonstrated the strong alpha2-6 receptor specificity associated with pandemic outbreaks or sustained human-to-human transmission.While natural H5 variants at numerous positions, including 133, 137, 138, 144, 155, 186, 187, 190, 192, 193, 196, and 197 (all H3 numbering), do appear to increase binding to human-type receptors, all examined isolates have been shown to retain equal or dominant binding to alpha2-3-linked glycans, suggestive of only partial adaptation.In vitro protein engineering studies using recombinant H5s, together with in vivo experiments aimed at directly evolving H5N1 viruses, have shown that the pathway toward full ""humanization,"" resulting in either fully altered receptor specificity or full airborne transmission in ferrets, is in fact quite complex and requires multiple adaptive changes.",1,0.5331963
199,"Mutations on Spike are found on the region where it binds to ACE2.The interaction between these two proteins appears to be important to the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2, but the impact of individual mutations in Spike is unknown.In addition, some people have different variants of ACE2 with mutations in the region that interacts with Spike, but it is not known whether this affects these people's risk of contracting COVID-19.To answer these questions, Barton et al.measured the precise effect of mutations in Spike and ACE2 on the strength of the interaction between the two proteins.The experiments showed that three of the five common Spike mutations in the Alpha, Beta and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants strengthened binding to ACE2.The two mutations that weakened binding were only found together with other mutations that strengthened binding.This meant that the Spike proteins in all three of these SARS-CoV-2 variants bind to ACE2 more strongly than the original form.The experiments also showed that two common variants of ACE2 also increased the strength of binding to Spike.Interestingly, one of these ACE2 variants reversed the effect of a specific SARS-CoV-2 mutation, suggesting that carriers would be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 variants with this mutation.Identifying the precise effects of Spike mutations on ACE2 binding helps understand why new variants of SARS-CoV-2 spread more rapidly.This could help to identify concerning new variants before they spread widely and inform the response by health authorities.The finding that two common ACE2 variants bind more strongly to Spike suggests that people with these mutations could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.IntroductionSince its identification in 2019, a coronavirus able to induce a severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans, SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in arguably the most severe infectious disease pandemic in 100 years.To date, more than 135 million people have been infected, resulting in the deaths from the resulting disease, COVID-19, of more than 3 million people, and measures introduced to control spread have had harmful social and economic impacts.Fortunately, effective vaccines have been developed, and a global vaccination programme is underway.New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are emerging that are making containment of the pandemic more difficult, perhaps by increasing transmissibility of the virus and/or its resistance to protective immunity induced by previous infection or vaccines.The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells following an interaction between the Spike (S) protein on its surface with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cell surfaces.The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein binds the membrane-distal portion of the ACE2 protein.The S protein forms a homotrimer, which is cleaved shortly after synthesis into two fragments that remain associated non-covalently: S1, which contains the RBD, and S2, which mediates membrane fusion following the binding of Spike to ACE2.During the pandemic, mutations have appeared in the Spike protein that may increase transmissibility.",1,0.88763297
245,"As antibodies against Spike harness the majority of neutralizing activity, selecting the optimal Spike variants in monovalent or multivalent vaccine strategies may be critical.Our study has important translatable implications to understand the natural history of COVID-19 and reinfection risk and breakthrough infection following vaccination.We have highlighted that molecular epidemiology and serosurveillance will both be required to detect emerging polymorphisms.Furthermore, sensitive monitoring of antibody binding and neutralization capacity will be paramount in vaccine design strategy and convalescent plasma therapy, and in seroprevalence studies, and this would require involvement of more rapidly adaptive methodologies to characterize the magnitude of the neutralization antibody responses against emerging variants.Materials and methodsParticipantsThis study investigated 2 cohorts of RT-PCR-confirmed convalescent individuals recruited from February to October 2020 in Australia (Table 1, Fig 1A).The Adapting to Pandemic Threats (ADAPT) cohort included 83 patients diagnosed at a community-based fever clinic whose sera was collected at 2 time points post-PCR positivity during the first wave (March to August, n = 166 samples).The second wave included sera from 17 patients recruited between July and October.The Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (Lifeblood) cohort (LIFE) included 645 sera samples from 159 donors collected at multiple time points post-PCR positivity (at least 28 days post-recovery) from volunteers presenting to Lifeblood for whole blood or plasma donation.The disease severity of ADAPT patients ranged from mildly symptomatic (mild), community managed (moderate) to critically unwell and hospitalized (hosp), whereas the self-reported disease severity of LIFE donors included community managed (nonhosp) and hospitalized (hosp) (Table 1).A healthy adult noninfected pre-pandemic cohort was collected in Australia and consisted of healthy and noninflammatory neurological disorder donors (n = 24).No reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 and no reinfection was reported.Ethics approval for this study was granted by St Vincent's Hospital (2020/ETH00964) and Lifeblood (30042020) Research Ethics Committees.Written consent was obtained from all ADAPT patients.In LIFE, the donor consent form included a statement that blood donation may be used in research.Flow cytometry cell-based assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodiesA flow cytometry cell-based assay detected patient serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens as for neuroimmunological autoantibodies.Individual SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike (Wuhan-1 D614, V367F, G476S, V483A, D614G, S477N/D614G, S477N/D614G/V1068F, B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), and B.1.351 (South Africa)), Membrane, and Envelope proteins were transiently expressed on transfected HEK293 cells.",1,0.798891
659,"Furthermore, WHO data shows there has been a substantial reduction of H5N1 human infections since 2015 to 2016, thus strongly reducing the potential for such evolution to occur and likely lowering the risk of a new pandemic.H7N9Human infections with avian H7N9 viruses were first reported in 2013 and, similar to H5N1, have been strongly associated with acute exposure to infected live poultry.Despite only recent appearance, human H7N9 infections have spread rapidly, with over 1500 confirmed cases and over 600 deaths worldwide between 2013 and 2019 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20190830.pdf?sfvrsn=30d65594_34, https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-september-2018-ah7n9-china/en/, June 2020).Also similarly to H5N1, zoonotic avian H7N9 isolates from human patients have typically retained strong binding to alpha2-3-linked receptors, suggesting only poor or partial adaptation to human hosts; however, given the rapid spread of human cases, and prior reports that H7 genes in alternate subtypes, including H7N7 and H7N2, can bind strongly to human receptors, close attention has been paid to circulating H7N9 strains due to the possibility of heightened pandemic potential.H7N9 strains have entered the human population through a series of seasonal epidemic outbreaks or ""waves,"" with the most severe fifth wave in 2017 featuring the largest number of cases, widest geographic spread, and emergence of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) strains.Emphasizing both the significance of the outbreak and growing global resources and research maturity in the influenza field, analyses of early first-wave H7N9 strains were particularly rapid, with numerous high-quality studies published within months of the first human infections.Early viral isolates were shown to contain numerous high-risk variants, including PB2 E627K (enhanced polymerase activity/virulence in mammals), NA R294K (oseltamivir resistance), and HA G186V and Q226L (receptor specificity switch mutations associated with pandemic viruses).Despite containing HA adaptive variants, solid-phase binding assays, including glycan microarrays, demonstrated early human H7N9 strains to have mixed receptor specificity and, in most cases, retained strong predominant binding to avian alpha2-3 receptors.Several crystal structures in complex with both avian and human receptor fragments revealed receptor-binding modes most in common with avian-adapted HAs, with human receptor cocomplexes showing a noncanonical conformation for the receptor glycan when compared with human HA counterparts.Pathogenesis studies revealed that while new H7N9 viruses did appear well adapted for infection and replication in various mammalian hosts, including mice, ferrets, pigs, and nonhuman primates, most isolates could not be efficiently transmitted via airborne respiratory droplets in the ferret model (typically only one out of three recipients) and were therefore unlikely to lead to significant human-to-human transmission.Since first-wave 2013 strains, H7N9 viruses have continued to circulate, becoming enzootic in birds and causing sporadic human infections in seasonal epidemic waves with little significant change in viral properties until a fifth epidemic in 2017 that led to the emergence of HPAI H7N9.",1,0.5351443

Virus-serum mix was then added onto ACE2-HEK293T cells (2.5 x 103/well) in a 384-well plate.Following spinoculation at 1,200g for 1 hour at 18 C, the cells were moved to 37 C for 72 hours.Entry of Spike particles was imaged by GFP-positive cells (InCell Analyzer) followed by enumeration with InCarta software (Cytiva, USA).Uninfected cells were run in parallel to account for background fluorescence signal.In infected cells, Spike-driven entry of lentiviral particles resulted in strong GFP expression, while the uninfected controls were negative for GFP (S8A and S8B Fig).Neutralization was measured by reduction in GFP expression relative to control group infected with the virus particles without any serum treatment.Serum dilution resulting in 50% reduction in GFP expression relative to the infected control was used to determine virus-cell fusion inhibition titers (S8B and S8C Fig).The cutoff of positivity for virus-cell fusion inhibition was 1:40.Accordingly, fusion inhibition was considered as absent when titers were below 1:40.Pre-pandemic healthy control sera (Privigen USA, P100103528, 2091200221, P100007516) showed no fusion inhibition and hence no reduction in GFP expression, thus confirmimg the specificity of the assay (S8C Fig).",1,0.6922322

655,"This, together with the prohibitively increased cost of industrial-scale cell-culture-based manufacturing, has largely prevented the widespread adoption of cell-culture-produced seasonal IAV vaccines; however, significant interest remains in engineering improved cell lines with both lower mutation rates and enhanced viral yields to one day to tackle this problem.One early successful example of this approach from Matrosovich and colleagues engineered MDCK cells to increase NeuAcalpha2-6Gal glycan receptors by stably transfecting the cells with the sialyltransferase gene, ST6Gal1, responsible for synthesis of this linkage.The resulting cell line, MDCK-SIAT1, showed increased recovery of H3N2 viruses from patient swabs.This approach has recently been extended by the Kawaoka group through similar overexpression of ST6Gal1 in MDCK cells, subsequent to removal via genetic knockouts of all ST3Gal sialyltransferase genes responsible for producing alpha2-3-linked avian-type receptors.The resulting cell line (hCK) maximizes the capping of glycans with NeuAcalpha2-6Gal linkages and significantly increases recovery of recent H3N2 strains from patient samples.Although glycomic analyses of MDCK cell lines are not yet available, it is clear that simply increasing the amount of NeuAcalpha2-6Gal receptors on these laboratory hosts appears sufficient to achieve enhanced receptor binding and infection by human influenza viruses.Compensatory changes in N2 NA activity that promote receptor bindingIt is widely accepted that IAVs require a balance between the receptor-binding avidity of HA and the receptor-destroying activity of NA for optimal binding and entry into host cells, avoidance of becoming trapped by mucins, and for release of newly synthesized virus particles from the infected cell.In general, this means that low-avidity HAs need to be coupled with low-activity NAs, and vice versa.Due to the very low avidity of recent H3 HAs for shorter alpha2-6 glycan receptors, propagation in MDCK cells frequently results in a low-activity N2 NA mutation, D151G, located within the catalytic site.D151G dramatically reduces NA activity, leading to NA replacing some of the role of HA for binding to glycan receptors on MDCK cells and mediating virus hemagglutination of erythrocytes in HAU titering assays.On glycan arrays D151G NAs bind both alpha2-3 and alpha2-6-linked sialosides, but show strong preference for alpha2-3 linkages, in keeping with their preference for these glycans as substrates.Importantly, when H3N2 viruses with this mutant NA are propagated on cultured human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, they have been shown to quickly revert to wild-type (D151), providing direct evidence that this variant is artificially selected for through passage in MDCK cell laboratory hosts.",1,0.72185665
547,"Strains are color coded.To further test preferential accumulation of mutations in the S glycoprotein, we measured single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome and separately in the S glycoprotein, normalized to their respective length.SARS-CoV was included in the analysis as it was closely related to SARS-CoV-2.Nucleotide accessions were added in increments of 50 or 10 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively.In both species, the S glycoprotein accumulated more polymorphic sites than the rest of the genome proportionately (Fig.2A).Using a chronological approach, SARS-CoV-2 accessions were analyzed by month from December 2019 to April 2020.For SARS-CoV, accessions were analyzed by year from 2003 to 2017.The number of polymorphic sites in the S glycoprotein was similar to or higher than that of the rest of the genome in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 over time (Fig.2B) and in all hosts (civets, humans, mice, and Vero cells) (Fig.2C).In SARS-CoV-2, the S glycoprotein represents approximately 17% of the genome (Fig.1B).However, it accumulated at least 50% of the mutations (Fig.1B).Accordingly, the S glycoprotein accumulated mutations at a frequency that is at least 3-fold higher than would be expected randomly.The frequency was even higher in accessions derived from nonhuman hosts and in SARS-CoV (Fig.2C).These results show that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is the most variable part of the genome.Nucleotide variation in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.(A) Nucleotide variation over accessions.(B) Nucleotide variation over time.(C) Nucleotide variation by host.The number of accessions in the analysis is indicated in parenthesis.Differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 based on the S glycoprotein.The variable nature of the S glycoprotein suggests it is a major contributor to SARS-CoV-2 evolution and diversification.To further test this model, using accessions from the United States, we generated a phylogenetic tree using the S glycoprotein and two time periods.Based on nucleotide (Fig.3A) or amino acid sequence (Fig.3B), accessions from January 2020 clustered separately from accessions from July and August 2020.With respect to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2), U.S. accessions from January accumulated two nucleotide substitutions (Fig.3C) and one amino acid (H49Y) substitution that maps to the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (Fig.3D).These mutations were not present on accessions from July and August 2020.Instead, eight new nucleotide (Fig.",1,0.77307534
422,"2).In order to place these genomes on a timed tree reconstruction, we conservatively used the week ending date of each pool.All RPN SARS-CoV-2 genomes were identified in specimens collected in the last week of February (ending on 29 February) and the first week of March (ending on 7 March), a time period when molecular diagnostic testing still was limited to individuals fulfilling a very narrow range of testing criteria.The sequences from these early infections map to four different PANGO lineages, B.1 (n = 4), B.1.5 (n = 1), B.2.12 (n = 1), and A.2 (n = 1), consistent with multiple independent introductions (Fig.2c, Supplementary Fig.2, and Table 1).All four lineages were detected subsequently during the peak in the spring of 2020 in NYC, which was dominated by the B.1 lineage.Notably, the B.1 RPN pools (P134, P41, P58, and P53) are nested within a cluster that was linked to the early community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in NYC, delineated by the additional substitutions ORF3a-Q57H and ORF1a-T265I.Global SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data between January and March 2020 is scarce, making it difficult to fully resolve the relationships between community spread and additional introductions during the early period of the outbreak in NYC.Lineage B.1 is a parent lineage to multiple emerging lineages that continue to circulate in the US, including lineage B.1.2 (N:P67S), which has become a dominant lineage in the US (NextStrain build, 17 February 2021, https://nextstrain.org/ncov).DiscussionTaken together, we provide clear evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infections were present in NYC at least 6 to 8 weeks prior to the surge of cases that flooded the NYC health system.Previous studies have suggested cryptic transmissions weeks prior to the first confirmed cases of community spread.Large retrospective testing efforts have probed for SARS-CoV-2 in banked nasopharyngeal specimens from at least seven states (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, Washington State, and California), with the earliest positive specimens dating back to 21 February 2020 (Seattle, WA and California).In addition, a recent serosurvey of blood products further suggests early undetected spread in multiple states across the US from December 2019 through January 2020.Of note, these studies relied solely on molecular testing without validation by viral genome sequencing.",1,0.58333355

653,"Figure adapted from data published in Peng et al.(2017) with permission from Cell Press, see manuscript for further details.Since the initial adaptation of H3N2 viruses to human-type receptors, they have circulated in the human population for over 50 years and over time have drifted to a more restricted receptor-binding specificity.This has become particularly evident during the last decade, where H3N2 isolates have proved increasingly difficult to recover in laboratory hosts and failed to hemagglutinate erythrocytes in standard hemagglutination titer assays.In several reports, H3N2 viruses isolated after 2003 were found to bind poorly to alpha2-6-linked sialoside receptors on glycan arrays and other solid-phase binding assays, leading to the conclusion that these viruses had lost specificity for human-type receptors.However, it subsequently became apparent that later H3N2 strains retained strong specificity for human-type receptors, but bound preferentially to a subset of extended sialic acid alpha2-6-linked glycans with additional N-acetyllactosamine (Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) repeat sequences.HAs from these viruses appeared to lose binding to human-type receptors as a result of substantial but selective loss of avidity for ""short"" alpha2-6 glycans including the sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine trisaccharide (NeuAcalpha2-6Galbeta1-4GlcNAc), commonly used in laboratory-based receptor assays (Fig.5).This restricted specificity of the H3 HA for only a subset of human-type receptors has had significant impact on influenza research and vaccine development since it coincided with, and likely directly contributed to, the inability of more recent H3N2 strains to propagate efficiently in laboratory hosts such as MDCK cells and eggs.Furthermore, poor binding to erythrocytes used in hemagglutination and HAI assays to measure virus titers and determine inhibitory potency of antibodies in serum, respectively, has proved an equally significant limitation even when potential vaccine strains can be grown successfully.Mismatches in receptor specificity of IAVs for their natural receptors in humans and receptors present in laboratory hosts are not new, having been described in 1949 by Burnet upon passage of H1N1 viruses in eggs resulting in a switch from the ""O"" (original) to ""D"" (derived) specificity, as measured by acquisition of hemagglutination with chicken erythrocytes.For recent H3N2 viruses, specificity mismatches are particularly consequential since commercial vaccines are produced in eggs, and primary H3N2 isolates grow poorly in these hosts due to the absence of extended alpha2-6 sialic acid receptors found in humans.Indeed, it is well documented that N-linked glycans found on cells lining the amniotic membrane of chicken eggs contain both human type (alpha2-6) and avian type (alpha2-3) sialic acid linkages; however, these receptors are found exclusively on short trisaccharide extensions attached to the Man3GlcNAc2Asn core.",1,0.68989724

Samples from all observed peaks were analysed on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2:figure supplement 1).Surface plasmon resonanceRBD binding to ACE2 was analysed on a Biacore T200 instrument (Cytiva) at 37 C and a flow rate of 30 microl/min.Running buffer was HBS-EP (Cytiva, BR100669).Streptavidin was coupled with a CM5 sensor chip (Cytiva, 29149603) using an amine coupling kit (Cytiva, BR100050) to near saturation, typically 10,000-12,000 response units (RU).Biotinylated ACE2 WT and variants were injected into the experimental flow cells (FC2-FC4) for different lengths of time to produce desired immobilisation levels (20-800 RU).FC1 was used as a reference and contained streptavidin only.Excess streptavidin was blocked with two 40 s injections of 250 microM biotin (Avidity).Before RBD injections, the chip surface was conditioned with eight injections of the running buffer.A dilution series of RBD was then injected in all FCs.Buffer alone was injected after every two or three RBD injections.The length of all injections was 30 s, and dissociation was monitored for 180-670 s. The background response measured in FC1 was subtracted from the response in the other three FCs.In addition, the responses measured during buffer injections closest in time were subtracted.Such double-referencing improves data quality when binding responses are low as needed to obtain accurate kinetic data.At the end of each experiment, an ACE2-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (NOVUS Biologicals, AC384) was injected at 5 microg/ml for 10 min to confirm the presence and relative amounts of immobilised ACE2.Data analysisDouble-referenced binding data was fitted using GraphPad Prism.The koff was determined by fitting a mono-exponential decay curve to data from the dissociation phase of each injection.The koff from four to six RBD injections was averaged (Figure 2:figure supplement 2A).The kon was determined by first fitting a mono-exponential association curve to data from the association phase, yielding the kobs, and then plotting the kobs vs the concentration of RBD and performing a linear fit of the equation kobs = kon*[RBD]+ koff to this data (Figure 2:figure supplement 2B), using the koff determined as above to constrain the fit.The KD was either calculated (calculated KD = koff/kon) or measured directly (equilibrium KD) as follows.Equilibrium binding levels at a given [RBD] were determined from the fit of the mono-exponential association phase model to the association phase data.",1,0.6376651
577,"Thus no substantial difference in neutralizing ability was seen between the WT Ab and the LALA mutant.Monocyte-derived macrophages do not show evidence of SARS-CoV-2 D614 antibody-dependent enhancementAt the onset of the pandemic, researchers cautioned against hasty vaccine and therapeutic antibody deployment due to the potential for ADE of infection, as has been documented with other viruses including dengue virus, Zika virus, and mutant feline enteric coronavirus.Briefly, ADE results when poorly neutralizing Abs or subneutralizing concentrations of neutralizing Abs bind virions and allow these immune-complexed virions to be uptaken into FcgammaR-expressing cells, where viral replication ensues.Because macrophages are recognized as being susceptible to ADE and have also been implicated in cytokine storm, we tested the mAbs in this study for SARS-CoV-2 D614 ADE in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages as previously described for Zika virus.Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in primary human monocyte derived macrophages.(a) Representative figure and histogram plot of intracellular ZIKV E protein showing ADE induced by humanized 4G2 antibody.This assay served as a positive control in these experiments.Intracellular viral E protein was increased in human macrophages when ZIKV was incubated with various concentrations of humanized 4G2 antibody prior to inoculation onto macrophages.ADE of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by changes in intracellular viral genomic RNA in macrophages and extracellular infectious particles released in culture supernatant.Viral RNA (b, c) and infectious viral particles (d, e) at 2 days post infection with SARS-CoV-2 pre-incubated with serial diluted COVID-19 patient convalescent plasma at MOI 1 (b, d) and MOI 0.25 (c, e).These data are shown as the mean with SD (n = 3-4).Each data point represents the average of a duplicate of each testing condition with individual donor macrophages.One-Way ANOVA was used to test the difference of viral titers between various concentration of patient plasma and virus only group.Fig.2To assess the risk of ADE mediated by a diverse/polyclonal pool of Abs, we serially diluted convalescent plasma samples from 3 donors who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 between March to May in 2020 and incubated these dilutions with SARS-CoV-2 D614 at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.25 and 1.These immune-complex solutions were then inoculated onto monocyte-derived macrophages from 3 to 4 donors.At 2 days post-infection, supernatants were evaluated by plaque forming assay on Vero E6 cells and infected cells were lysed and tested for viral genomic RNA for E gene by RT-qPCR.At all four plasma dilutions ranging from 0.004% to 4%, minimal increase in viral RNA (Fig.2 b and c) and supernatant virus (Fig.2d and e) was seen for any of the plasma-macrophage donor pairs.This contrasted with our control experiment in which a higher percentage of Zika virus E protein-expressing cells were detected in macrophage cultures incubated with pan-flavivirus humanized mAb 4G2 at concentrations of 0.000032 mg/mL and higher (Fig.",1,0.8304135
714,"No substitutions were observed within the active site of the exoribonuclease proofreading domain.The methyltransferase domain displayed a high level of conservation with only three of 12 active site residues substituted.Two guanine cap binding residues (N306 and F426) were found substituted, with N306S (conservative, surface) observed as a single amino acid change and F426L observed once in the double-substitution USV F426L;S448Y.One SAM binding residue was substituted: Q354H (nonconservative, boundary) was observed in five independently sequenced viral genomes.While we did not generate structural models of the nsp14/nsp10 heterodimer, the structure of SARS-CoV-1 nsp14/nsp10 heterodimer (PDB ID 5C8S) allowed us to predict which SARS-CoV-2 amino acid changes may affect nsp10/nsp14 heterodimer formation.Sixteen nsp14 sites of substitution (T5, P24, H26, L27, K47, M62, N67, Y69, V101, N129, T131, K196, V199, I201, P203, and F217, giving a total of 21 distinct substitutions) and eight nsp10 sites of substitution (T12, A18, A20, Y30, A32, I81, K93, and K95, giving a total of 13 distinct substitutions) were mapped to the putative nsp14/nsp10 interface, of which 18 were conservative and 16 were nonconservative.The most prevalent substitutions were T12 (surface, T12I and T12N), A32 (surface, A32S and A32V), H26Y (surface), and P203 (surface, P203L and P203S).Nonstructural proteins 10 and 16 methyltransferase (nsp10/nsp16)Nonstructural proteins nsp10 and nsp16 are both found within pp1ab, from which they are excised by nsp5.Together, nsp10 and nsp16 form a stable heterodimer that functions as a methyltransferase, acting on the 2' OH of the ribose of the first nucleotide of the viral genome (i.e., 5'(m7Gp)(ppAm)[pN] n , where Am denotes 2'-O-ribose methyl-adenosine).This process renders the viral cap structure indistinguishable from that of eukaryotic cap-1, thereby disguising the viral genome so that it resembles cellular RNAs typically found in multicellular organisms and protecting the viral genome from cellular 5' exonucleases.Enzyme activity of nsp16 depends on SAM as a cofactor, which donates the methyl group from the methionine group for transfer to the ribose of the capped viral RNA.",1,0.83996075

223,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies: Longevity, breadth, and evasion by emerging viral variantsThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody neutralization response and its evasion by emerging viral variants and variant of concern (VOC) are unknown, but critical to understand reinfection risk and breakthrough infection following vaccination.Antibody immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike variants, inhibition of Spike-driven virus-cell fusion, and infectious SARS-CoV-2 neutralization were characterized in 807 serial samples from 233 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) individuals with detailed demographics and followed up to 7 months.A broad and sustained polyantigenic immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins, along with high viral neutralization, was associated with COVID-19 severity.A subgroup of ""high responders"" maintained high neutralizing responses over time, representing ideal convalescent plasma donors.Antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 during the first COVID-19 wave had reduced immunoreactivity and neutralization potency to emerging Spike variants and VOC.Accurate monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses would be essential for selection of optimal responders and vaccine monitoring and design.IntroductionControl of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic relies on population resistance to infection due to a postinfection and vaccination-induced immunity.Current questions relate to the level, breadth, and longevity of generated immunity and whether mutation of the virus will compromise immunity.Previous studies reported varying results in longitudinal changes of the virus-specific antibody response.Some detected stable antibody titers 4 to 6 months after diagnosis, while others reported waning of the antibody response 2 to 3 months after infection.Differences in assay sensitivity and antigen targets may account for these discrepancies, with Spike and Nucleocapsid being the main antigens investigated.Immunoreactivity to other abundant antigens, such as Membrane or Envelope, is unknown.Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for antibodies that bind to Spike, a large homotrimeric glycoprotein studded across the viral surface, whereas Membrane and Envelope proteins, although exposed on the viral surface, remain to be identified as neutralizing antibody targets.Rapid development of neutralizing antibody response to Spike correlates with viral immunity, and individuals who seroconvert may develop a lasting neutralization response.The SARS-CoV-2 virus has accumulated many polymorphisms across its genome, especially within the Spike gene.",1,0.89669955
183,"However, we were unable to detect stable protein following transfection with the MIRb-ACE2 K2R-encoding mutant (Fig.5d).Consistent with this, the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was sufficient to increase protein levels of ACE2, but did not rescue the MIRb-ACE2 protein product (Fig.5d).Moreover, cycloheximide treatment of HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG tagged ACE2 or MIRb-ACE2 constructs led to the rapid loss of MIRb-ACE2 protein, but did not affect levels of full-length ACE2 in the same time frame (Fig.5e), further supporting reduced stability of the former.Structural considerations suggested that the MIRb-ACE2 protein product would unlikely retain the partial structure of the canonical ACE2 peptidase fold, as removing most of the this subdomain would expose the remaining component of the highly charged substrate-binding groove as well as large parts of the hydrophobic protein core (Extended Data Fig.9).Hence, it seems unlikely that a protein coded by the MIRb-ACE2 transcript would form a structure similar to that of the canonical ACE2.Moreover, the MIRb-ACE2 protein product lacks a canonical signal peptide and when an IgG kappa chain-derived signal peptide, which has been successfully used to express the canonical ACE2 ectodomain (residues 15-615), was fused to the corresponding domain of the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein (residues 1-269), there was no detectable secreted protein.These data suggest that the latter protein is subject to post-translational degradation through a proteasome-independent mechanism and therefore unlikely to exert significant biological activity.Nevertheless, as the MIRb-ACE2 protein was indeed made under certain conditions, it remained possible that it retained some biological function or that it affected the function of canonical ACE2 through heterodimer formation.To examine this possibility, we quantified levels of enzymatically active ACE2, an assay that is considerably more sensitive than Western blotting, and found, as expected, strong enzymatic activity in lysates from ACE2-transfected, but not MIRb-ACE2-transfected cells (Fig.5f).Furthermore, co-transfection with MIRb-ACE2 did not affect the enzymatic activity conferred by ACE2 transfection (Fig.5f).To determine any involvement of the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we measured binding of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the first step of viral entry, to cells expressing either or both ACE2 isoforms.",1,0.6081305

732,"We have assumed that none of observed USVs yielded study proteins that either failed to fold or lost necessary biochemical functionality for other reasons, because it is likely given the timing of specimen collection that all the viral RNAs were isolated from infected individuals and are, therefore, presumed to have been infectious.For sequence identity calculations, GenBank accession code AY278741.1 was used as the source of SARS-CoV-1 protein reference sequences.Experimentally-determined structures of study proteins from the PDB archiveAtomic coordinates for the experimental structures of 19 study proteins were downloaded from the PDB archive via the RCSB PDB website (RCSB.org), including nsp1 (PDB ID 7K3N), nsp3a (PDB ID 7KAG), nsp3b (PDB ID 6WEY), Papain-like Proteinase (PLPro; nsp3d; PDB ID 6WUU), nsp3e (PDB ID 7LGO), nsp5 (PDB ID 6YB7), nsp7 (part of the RDRP; PDB ID 6YYT), nsp8 (part of the RDRP; PDB ID 6YYT), nsp9 (PDB ID 6WXD), nsp10 (part of the methyltransferase; PDB ID 6WVN), nsp12 (part of the RDRP; PDB ID 6YYT), nsp13 (PDB ID 6JYT), nsp15 (PDB ID 6WXC), nsp16 (part of the methyltransferase; PDB ID 6WVN), S-protein (PDB ID 6VXX; PDB ID 6M17), Orf3a (PDB ID 6XDC), Orf7a (PDB ID 7CI3), Orf8 (PDB ID 7JX6), and the N-protein (PDB ID 6VYO; PDB ID 6YUN).Computed structural models of study proteinsSwiss-Model was the source of the computed structural model nsp3c (part of nsp3) using 75% sequence identical template SARS-CoV-1 nsp3c (part of nsp3) (PDB ID 2W2G).The computed structural model for nsp14 (https://robetta.bakerlab.org/results.php?id=15671) was downloaded from the Robetta-based predictions from the website for Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (https://www.ssgcid.org/cttdb/molecularmodel_list/?organism__icontains=COVID-19).The computed structural model for the SARS-CoV-2 E-protein were generated using the solution state NMR structure of the SARS-CoV-1 E-protein embedded in lyso-myristoyl phosphatidylglycerol micelles (PDB ID 5X29, model 1) as a template, and substituting differing residues using the MUTATE feature of VMD.The structural model was then subjected to 10 000 steps of energy minimization in vacuum using NAMD 2.13 and the CHARMM 36 force field.Computed structural models for the seven remaining study proteins were obtained from the Rosetta-based Baker group predictions (TS131) CASP website (https://predictioncenter.org/caspcommons/targetlist.cgi; Model 1 was chosen), including nsp2, UNK (part of nsp3), nsp4, nsp6, the M-protein, Orf6, and Orf7b.nsp11, Orf9b, Orf14, and hypothetical protein Orf10 were excluded from consideration owing to lack of sequence and/or 3D structure data.Molecular visualization and graphicsThe RCSB Protein Data Bank web-native molecular graphics tool (Mol*) was used for visual inspection and comparison of reference and amino-acid-substitute study proteins.Space-filling representation figures were generated using Illustrate.Ribbon/atomic stick figure representation figures were generated using Mol* and PyMOL.Rosetta-based analyses of substitution location(s), conservation, and energeticsPyRosetta was used to analyze each study protein and its observed USVs.All residue pairs with Calpha-Calpha distance <5.5 A were considered neighbors, and residue pairs with Calpha-Calpha distance <11 A were also considered neighbors if their Calpha-Cbeta vectors were at an angle <75 .Residue layer identifications were performed on reference (rather than substituted) study protein structures, based on side chain neighbors within a cone centered on the Calpha-Cbeta vector, which is independent of side chain conformation.The Layer Determination Factor (LDF) is defined as LDF = ((cos[theta] + 0.5)/1.5)2/(1 + exp[d - 9]), where theta is the angle between the Calpha-Cbeta vector of a given residue and that of a neighbor, and d is the Calpha-Calpha distance between residue and neighbor.LDF is summed over nearby neighbors and if its value is <2, the residue is considered surface.If it is >5.2, the residue is considered core.",1,0.8293039

42,"Influenza C virus is the third human influenza virus type and consists of seven genome segments.The surface of the influenza C virus is characterized by a single spike protein named hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein, which conveys both receptor-binding and -destroying functions.Hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein is also present in influenza D viruses, where it plays a major role in binding to trachea sections from human, swine, and bovine origin.3.Antigenic Drift in Influenza VirusInfluenza infections arise in the human population through seasonal epidemics, occurring during various cyclical periods in different regions across the globe.Currently, approved influenza vaccines rely on the immune system to target immunity against the viral HA protein.Seasonal vaccines are critical in protecting the population against influenza and in-depth analyses and redesign must be performed regularly to keep up with the constantly evolving circulating influenza stains.The fast-paced changes in circulating strains are due to antigenic drift.Antigenic drift is the result of mutations occurring in the surface proteins and other viral proteins due to error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacking the ability to proofread during viral replication.These amino acid changes in both the HA and the NA surface glycoproteins are key factors in antigenic drift, as these substitutions lead to immune evasion of the virus and allow the virus to propagate in a population and emerge as a novel epidemic strain.These continuous changes in the virus lead to the virus existing as quasispecies.Mapping and sequencing analysis of the surface glycoproteins of escape mutants has helped define five antigenic sites on the HA glycoprotein, named A-E. Of the surface proteins, the HA glycoprotein is considered the primary focus of antigenic drift, which may be an area of oversight in vaccine evaluation and formulation as it is the primary focus in vaccine design.With each viral particle entering a host cell for replication, these changes at the amino acid level result in the gradual accumulation of mutations, brought upon by selective pressure of the host immune system or antiviral drugs.Since the discovery of the A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) influenza A virus, there has been a redesign of the seasonal vaccines at least once a year, from November 1998 to April 1999, to the 2021-2022 quadrivalent vaccine.Furthermore, antigenic drift in influenza A/H3N2 has illustrated how some amino acid substitutions can result in little to no escape variants, while some substitutions can create the emergence of new subspecies that have the potential to cause an epidemic.The influenza A/H3N2 stain from 2005 to 2006 showed a single point-mutation at position 31 of the M2 protein, a transmembrane ion channel that equilibrates pH across the viral membrane upon entry into a host cell.",1,0.8002363

546,"Conversely, antibodies developed through natural infection or vaccines may impose selection pressure on beta-CoVs.For these and other reasons, it is imperative to understand the biological properties of beta-CoVs that contribute to the emergence of new strains and species.Virus variation, evolution, and adaptation to diverse hosts are mediated by genetic determinants in the viral genome and selection pressure imposed by the host.Accordingly, characterization of genomic variation is fundamental to our understanding of beta-CoV evolution and host adaptation.We hypothesized that genetic determinants of variation in beta-CoVs are conserved across species, including SARS-CoV-2.In this study, we profiled the genomic variation in all species in the genus Betacoronavirus.Genome-wide nucleotide variation analyses combined with amino acid variation analyses revealed that variation patterns are conserved across beta-CoVs, including the presence of variable areas at homologous locations.The most variable parts are the S glycoprotein, followed by open reading frame 8, accessory proteins 3 and 7, and the N protein.Genome-wide distribution of mutations of all beta-CoVs provides an explanation for the emergence of new beta-CoV species, such as SARS-CoV-2, and for the emergence of strains.These findings and published results predict how and where SARS-CoV-2 will accumulate mutations and differentiate into new biological strains.SARS-CoV-2 will likely evolve as it adapts to genetically diverse human populations and possibly to selection constraints imposed by vaccines, antiviral drugs, and antibodies developed against natural infections.Our results underscore the potential for the continual emergence of new beta-CoV species and strains with novel biological properties.RESULTSS glycoprotein is more variable than the rest of the genome.SARS-CoV-2 strains identified to date differ in the accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions in the entire genome (Fig.1A).However, nonsynonymous substitutions preferentially accumulate in the S glycoprotein and in the N protein.In all other parts of the genome, mutations accumulate to a frequency that is equal to or less than that expected randomly (Fig.1B).New mutations continue to arise and diversify SARS-CoV-2 into variants.However, recurrent mutations mapped along the SARS-CoV-2 genome preferentially accumulate in the S glycoprotein.Amino acid substitutions in UK, South Africa, and Brazil SARS-CoV-2 strains.(A) Location of amino acid mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.Coordinates are based on accession no.NC_045512.2.(B) Proportion of amino acid substitutions observed and randomly expected based on the length of each protein or open reading frame.Strains are color coded.To further test preferential accumulation of mutations in the S glycoprotein, we measured single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome and separately in the S glycoprotein, normalized to their respective length.SARS-CoV was included in the analysis as it was closely related to SARS-CoV-2.",1,0.57901675

727,"Computational 3D structure modeling of the USVs demonstrated that substitutions primarily occurred in the boundary layers and the surfaces of the viral proteins.Most of the amino acid changes appear to be moderately destabilizing, as judged by the results of energetics (DeltaDeltaG App) calculations.Given that most of the viral genomes archived by GISAID were obtained from samples provided by infected individuals, we believe that the viruses and hence the viral proteins were functional and capable of causing disease in humans.Where multiple substitutions were detected in a USV, we believe that most were the product of cumulative changes.At least one of the observed amino acid changes in multisubstitution USVs was almost always detected as a single substitution in another USV derived from a sample collected earlier in the pandemic.There is every reason to believe that the pool of viruses circulating in humans and other mammals (e.g., Mustela lutreola or European mink) around the world today will continue to diverge from the reference sequence.We have made 3D structure models of 7462 USVs and our analysis results freely available under the most permissive Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license to facilitate the work of research groups using experimental and computational tools to characterize SARS-CoV-2 protein function and study the structural and functional consequences of the myriad substitutions observed during the first half of 2020.Some, almost certainly not all, of the 29 viral proteins analyzed herein represent promising targets for discovery and development of small-molecule anti-viral agents.At the time of writing, one small-molecule drug (remdesivir targeting the RdRp) has received full approval from the US FDA.This compound was originally discovered during the search for an Ebola virus therapeutic.Although it failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials for Ebola victims, the safety profile encouraged the sponsor company (Gilead Sciences Inc.) to successfully repurposed the drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.Open access to PDB structures of remdesivir bound to the RdRp sets the stage for structure-guided discovery of second generation nucleoside analogs with superior potency and/or selectivity, more desirable drug-like properties, or better Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion profiles (e.g., improved oral bioavailability to avoid intravenous administration).Open access to our computed 3D structural models of 840 RdRp USVs will provide useful information that may enable drug hunting teams to anticipate potential sources of drug resistance during selection for candidates slated for in vitro pre-clinical development studies.Open access to PDB structures of other essential SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (and those of their closely related SARS-CoV-1 homologs) have already facilitated initiation of structure-guided drug discovery campaigns for PLPro, nsp5, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp10/nsp16.",1,0.7611306

649,"Indeed, it is well recognized that zoonotic avian viruses typically require adaptive changes within the viral polymerase complex in order to achieve successful replication within human cells.2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses inherited the PB1 gene via a swine lineage that emerged in the late 1990s from human H3N2 strains, a combination that may not have been prevalent or even possible at an earlier time, and which likely conferred significant host-adaptative potential.Although early 2009 pandemic strains did appear well adapted in terms of human receptor specificity, several studies have shown that HA-binding avidities from the earliest isolates were very low, but rapidly evolved to higher avidity after initial circulation in humans.Several groups have also highlighted the importance of balanced HA/NA activities in human influenza viruses for this pandemic virus, and it appears likely that the H1 genetic lineage that gave rise to 2009 pandemic strains would not have been able to emerge without the combination of a complementary low-activity N1 gene, in this case emerging from a more distant Eurasian swine background.Subsequent strains evolved from the pandemic now appear to have adapted as seasonal strains with improved HA receptor binding and NA activity.1957 H2N2 pandemicIn 1957, a novel pandemic influenza strain thought to have originated in Japan circulated globally through the human population, rapidly replacing seasonal H1N1 strains that had persisted in humans since the 1918 pandemic.Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that human H2N2 strains arose through reassortment of established human H1N1 viruses with Eurasian lineage avian H2N2, leading to transfer of the PB1, HA, and NA genes (Fig.1C).Thus, while the novel pandemic virus retained substantial similarity to 1918-descended strains internally, with five out of six internal genes conserved, the H2N2 viruses expressed completely novel HA and NA surface glycoproteins, leading to substantial disease and rapid spread among an immunologically naive population.The receptor specificity of early human H2N2 strains typically showed a mixture of binding to alpha2-6 human-type and alpha2-3 avian-type receptors, in contrast to avian H2 viruses that preferentially bound alpha2-3 avian-type receptors.Some of the earliest H2 isolates were found to have a mixture of two virus subtypes (e.g., A/RI/5/57 and A/Japan/305/57) called the (+) and (-) subtypes.The (+) subtype was specific for alpha2-6 human-type receptors and strongly sensitive to inhibition of hemagglutination (HAI) by equine alpha2-macroglobulin in horse serum, a glycoprotein with alpha2-6-linked sialoglycans that are potent competitive inhibitors for human viruses.In contrast, the (-) subtype bound alpha2-3 avian-type receptors and was completely resistant to HAI by horse serum, the phenotype exhibited by avian H2 influenza viruses.Since receptor binding can drift during laboratory passage, particularly within chicken eggs, it is not known which subtype was dominant in the initial human infections, but appears likely that the pandemic spread would have been driven by the alpha2-6 human-type-binding (+) subtype, even if both (+) and (-) variants were able to cocirculate during this time.",1,0.7833807

203,"K26R is observed in all the major gnomAD populations but is most common in Ashkenazi Jews (1%) and (non-Finnish) north-western Europeans (0.6%).It is less common in Africans/African-Americans and South Asians (0.1%) and rare in Finnish (0.05%) and East-Asian (0.001%) populations.The S19P mutant is almost exclusively found in Africans/African-Americans (0.3%).Measurement of affinity and kineticsTo measure the effects of these mutations on the affinity and kinetics of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which allows very accurate measurements, provided that common pitfalls are avoided, particularly protein aggregation, mass-transport limitations, and rebinding.Monomeric, soluble forms of the ectodomain of ACE2 and the Spike RBD were expressed in human cells, to retain native glycosylation, and purified (Figure 2:figure supplement 1).ACE2 was captured onto the sensor surface via a carboxy-terminal biotin and RBD injected over ACE2 at different concentrations (Figure 2A).Excellent fits of 1:1 Langmuir binding model to the data yielded an association rate constant (kon) of 0.9 +- 0.05 muM-1s-1 and a dissociation rate constant (koff) of 0.067 +- 0.0011 s-1 (mean +- SD, n = 6, Table 1).These rate constants are up to 25- fold faster than previously reported for the same interaction.However, previous experiments were conducted at unphysiologically low temperatures (i.e.below 37 C) and under conditions in which mass-transport limitations and rebinding are highly likely (see Discussion).These factors, and the presence of protein aggregates, would all lower the measured rate constants.In contrast, our measurements were conducted at 37 C and under conditions in which mass-transfer limitation and rebinding were excluded.The latter is demonstrated by the fact that measured kon and koff rates approached maximal values at the low level of ACE2 immobilisation (~50 RU) used in our experiments (Figure 2B,C).The excellent fit of the 1:1 binding model to our data excludes an effect of protein aggregates, which yield complex kinetics.The calculated dissociation constant (KD) was 74 +- 4 nM (mean +- SD, n = 6, Table 1).We also measured KD by equilibrium binding (Figure 2D), which avoids any artefacts induced by mass transfer limitations and rebinding.This KD was very similar to the value calculated from kinetic data (63 +- 7.7 nM [mean +- SD, n = 24, Table 1]), and did not vary with immobilisation level (Figure 2E), further validating our kinetic measurements.",1,0.8940493
