Auto-CORPus tables key

A BioC style format for tables extracted by Auto-CORPus from biomedical literature HTML documents and image files.

source:                 Auto-CORPus (tables)

date:                   yyyymmdd. Date document processed by Auto-CORPus.

key:                    autocorpus_tables.key

document:               Biomedical literature table

inputfile:              Local path to the HTML file processed by Auto-CORPus. For linked tables, the input file can differ between tables.

id:                     Unique table identifier. For inline tables an incremental integer is used starting at 1 for the first table encountered. For linked tables the integer identifier comes from the filename. For sub-tables (shared table grid with the primary table by uses new column headings) the table is identified using the primary table identifier followed by an underscore followed by an incremental integer starting at 1 for the first sub-table encountered e.g. "1_1".

passage:                One portion of a biomedical literature table, such as a caption, table content (in columns and rows), or a footer. Details provided by section_type.

offset:                 The first passage has an offset of zero. Each following passage has an offset increased by the number of characters in the text of a passage. The offsets sequence the passages and can be used to identify entities in annotations.

infon section_title_1:  A local label applied to table sections: table_title, table_caption, table_content, table_footer. A local label is used since some IAO terms are not specific to tables.

infon iao_name_1:       An Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) term name to describe the section type and the name for iao_id_1. An additional IAO name is iao_name_2, and so on.

infon iao_id_1:         An Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) term identifier to describe the section type and the identifier for iao_name_1. In the form of the "IAO" prefix, colon, followed by the seven-digit identifier, e.g. "IAO:0000305". An additional IAO identifier is iao_id_2, and so on.

text:                   The text of the passage

column_headings:        A column heading cell text and identifier pair. Column headings are in the order they occur in the table reading from left to right. Included when section_label = "table_content".

cell_text:              Table column heading or data cell text. Included when section_label = "table_content".

cell_id:                Unique cell identifier.  Can be used to identify cells in annotations. In the format of table id, row id integer ("1" is the column header row) and column id integer ("1" is the left-most column) separated by periods e.g. "1_1.1.1". Included when section_label = "table_content".

data_section:           One section of a table that shares column headings. Groups section titles and results rows. Included when section_label = "table_content".

table_section_title_1:  Section title. Included when section_title_1 = "table_content".

data_rows:              A data row cell text and identifier pair. Data cells are in the order they occur in the table reading from left to right. Included when section_label = "table_content".
