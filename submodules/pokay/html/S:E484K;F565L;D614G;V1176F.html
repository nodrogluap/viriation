<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The study demonstrated 1.92 and 1.09 fold reductions (ELISA) in the neutralizing titer against B.1.1.28.2 (P2) variant (n=2 authentic virus) in comparison with prototype D614G variant with 42 sera of BBV152 (a.k.a. Covaxin) vaccine recipients  2mo post-booster and 19 natural infections respectively.<br/> [exact P.2 sequences were not given, using the common defining SNPs] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.30.441559" class="lit_link">Sapkal et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Study 3001 on Ad26.COV2.S (Jannsen vaccine) conducted September 21, 2020 through January 22, 2021 overlaps the emergence and dominance  of the P.1 & P.2 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. The Brazilian arm of the Phase 3 double blind study showed severe/critical disease VE of 81.9%  (95% CI: 17.0-98.1), and moderate to severe/critical disease VE of 66.2% (95% CI: 51.0-77.1). Compare to 78.0% and 74.4% for North American arm of the study during the same period (with low B.1.351 prevalence). Of the 69.3% of mostly severe infections sequenced as of this report, 69.4% were of P.2 lineage [defining lineage SNPs reported here].<br/> (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download" class="lit_link">Janssen Biotech (2021)</a>)</span></li>
