This is in line with the key roles of K417, E484, and N501, in particular E484, in antibody recognition  of the ACE2 interaction surface of the RBD.<br/>Regeneron mAb cocktail: The neutralization of REGN10987 was unaffected by B.1.351, while REGN10933 was severely impaired (773-fold). AstraZeneca mAb cocktail: Neutralization by the AZ pair of antibodies was little affected on B.1.351 compared with Victoria.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.037" class="lit_link">Zhou et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In 34 convalescent cases 4–9 weeks following infection in June 2020, before the emergence of B.1.1.7, neutralization titers  against B.1.351 were, on average, 13.3-fold reduced compared with an early Victoria sample (p < 0.0001). Significantly, 18  of 34 samples failed to reach 50% neutralization at a plasma dilution of 1:20, with a number showing a near total reduction of neutralization activity.<br/>In 13 convalescent cases 4–9 weeks following infection with B.1.1.7, neutralization titers  against B.1.351 were, on average, 3.1-fold reduced compared with an early Victoria sample (p < 0.0001). <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.037" class="lit_link">Zhou et al.
