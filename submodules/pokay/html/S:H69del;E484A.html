<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade  immunity from prior infection, evidenced by a reinfection hazard ratio of 2.39 (CI95: 1.88-3.11) relative to primary infection in the initial part of South Africa's 4th covid-19 wave (November 2021).<br/>In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants.
