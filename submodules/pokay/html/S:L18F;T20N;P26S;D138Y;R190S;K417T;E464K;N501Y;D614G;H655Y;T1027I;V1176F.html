<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> P.1 virus neutralization (as tested using biolayer interferometry) of both Lilly antibodies was severely impacted,  with Lilly mAb combination LY-CoV16 and LY-CoV555  (due to mutations at 416 and 484 respectively) shows almost complete loss of neutralization of P.1.<br/>There was also escape from neutralization of P.1 by REGN10933 (one of 2 in Regeneron's mAb cocktail)  and a modest reduction in neutralization of P.1 by AstraZeneca's AZD8895 (while AZD1061 and AZD7442 showed  equal neutralization of all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested).<br/>The three Adagio antibodies neutralized P.1 with all reaching a plateau at 100% neutralization; interestingly, ADG30  showed a slight increase of neutralization of P.1.<br/> S309 Vir was largely unaffected, although for several viruses, including P.1, the antibody failed to completely  neutralize, conceivably reflecting incomplete glycosylation at N343, since the sugar interaction is key to binding of this antibody.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.055" class="lit_link">Dejnirattisai et al.
