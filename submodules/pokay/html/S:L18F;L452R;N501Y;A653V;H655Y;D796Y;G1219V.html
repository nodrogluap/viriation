<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> This variant was designated A.27.RN according to its phylogenetic clade classification. It emerged in parallel  with the B.1.1.7 variant, increased to >50% of all SARS-CoV-2 variants by week five. Subsequently it decreased  to <10% of all variants by calendar week eight when B.1.1.7 had become the dominant strain. Antibodies induced  by BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccination neutralized A.27.RN but with a two-to-threefold reduced efficacy as compared to the  wild-type and B.1.1.7 strains.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.21254849" class="lit_link">Mallm et al.
