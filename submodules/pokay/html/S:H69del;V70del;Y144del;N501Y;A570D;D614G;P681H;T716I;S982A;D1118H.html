Adjusted rate reduction in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity infection compared with unvaccinated workers 1-14 days  after 1st dose was 30% (95% CI: 2-50), and 75% (95% CI: 72-84) after 15-28 days. Adjusted rate reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 compared with  unvaccinated workers 1-14 days after 1st dose was 47% (95% CI: 17-66), and 85% (95% CI: 71-92) after 15-28 days. [Though often cited as an indicator of VE for B.1.1.7, during this time period in Israel, the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant increased from ~20% to 50% of  cases (covariants.org), therefore these VE numbers likely represent a mix of B.1.1.7 and other lineage effects.] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00448-7" class="lit_link">Amit et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> We found that a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine is about 60-70% effective at preventing symptomatic disease in adults aged 70 years  and older in England and that two doses are about 85-90% effective. Those who were vaccinated and went on to have symptoms had a 44%  lower risk of being admitted hospital and a 51% lower risk of death compared with people who were unvaccinated. We also found that a single dose  of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine was about 60-75% effective against symptomatic disease and provided an additional protective effect against hospital  admission—it is too early to assess the effect on mortality. The B.1.1.7 variant now dominates in the UK and these results will largely  reflect vaccine effectiveness against this variant.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1088" class="lit_link">Lopez Bernal et al.
