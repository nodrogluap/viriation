<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Lentiviral pseudotyped with this mutation set from Mink Cluster 5 lineage, was tested on ACE2.293T cells. Luciferase activity was measured two days postinfection,  showing slight decrease in infection rate amongst the cells, much closer to D614G activity level than Y453F alone, suggesting compensatory effects between the  deletion and the mutation in human cell entry fitness.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.430003" class="lit_link">Tada et al.
