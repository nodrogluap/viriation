Household  contacts exposed to the "California" or "West Coast" variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429) were at higher risk of infection compared  to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.36 vs 0.29, RR=1.28; 95% CI:1.00-1.64).<br/>The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020.
