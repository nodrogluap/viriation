<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In the Southern Brazilian stats of Rio Grande do Sul, comparing pre-P.1 and post-P.1 waves: .<br/>The increase in Case Fatality Rate occurred in a greatest intensity in the population between 20 and 59 years old and among patients without pre-existing risk conditions. Female 20 to 39 years old, with no pre-existing risk conditions, were at risk of death 5.65 times higher in February (95%CI = 2.9 - 11.03; p <0.0001) and in the age group of 40 and 59 years old, this risk was 7.7 times higher (95%CI = 5.01-11.83; p <0.0001) comparing with.<br/>November-December. This maybe due to a combination of changes in pathogenicity and virulence profiles, and health system overload.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> On average across 7 European countries studied, using P.1 defining mutations:.<br/>Significant shift to infection in those without pre-existing conditions (27.8% vs 89% for non-VOC cases). Significant increase in hospitalization rate (20% vs 7.5% for non-VOC cases).<br/>Significant increase in ICU rate (2.1% vs 0.6% for non-VOC cases). Significant increase in health care worker rate (19.8% vs 8.0% for non-VOC cases).<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.16.2100348" class="lit_link">Funk et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In the Parana state of Brazil, patients aged 20-29 years experienced a tripling of their case fatality rate (CFR), from 0.04% to 0.13%, while those aged  30-39, 40-49, 50-59 experienced approximate CFR doubling comparing February to January in 2021. Notably,  the observed CFR increase coincided with the second consecutive month of declining number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 cases.<br/>Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest significant increases in CFR in young and middle-aged adults after  identification of a novel SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating in Brazil. <br/> [this is somewhat indirect evidence that assume greatly increasing proportion of P.1 cases in March (70%) compared to .<br/>February, but the first official ID of P.1 in Parana state (Feb 16th) may be due to testing procedures rather than actual prevalence] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.21254046" class="lit_link">Santos de Oliviera et al.
