<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Partial sequencing of S gene reveals two cases of probable early 2021 B.1.1.7 lineage reinfection from non-B.1.1.7 original cases in Lombardy, with 45 to 90 days between infections (less than the typical 90 day guideline for this call).<br/>Patients were 56 and 58yo, immunocompenent, with one a former smoker with obesity and dyslipidemia. One case required intubation during first infection,  but presented with mild symptoms upon reinfection. The other case convalesced at home during the first episode, but required CPAP support  in the subacute clinical unit upon reinfection.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27066" class="lit_link">Novazzi et al.
