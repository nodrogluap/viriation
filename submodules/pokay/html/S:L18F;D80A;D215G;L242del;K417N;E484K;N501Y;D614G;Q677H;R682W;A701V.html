<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the S protein found in the B.1.351 lineage and (2) mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351.<br/>In a mouse study, primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273.351 was effective at increasing neutralizing antibody titers against the B.1.351 lineage,  while mRNA-1273.211 was most effective at providing broad cross-variant neutralization. In addition, these results demonstrated a third dose of  mRNA-1273.351 significantly increased both wild-type and B.1.351-specific neutralization titers. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.439482" class="lit_link">Wu et al.
