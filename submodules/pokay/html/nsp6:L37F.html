<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> No biochemical data, but high quality non-synonymous homoplasies from a paper, where functional fitness is presumed.<br/> PG: Effect is synonymous (F34=), with the variant containing the optimal human codon (UUU) vs reference (UUC).<br/> PG: Has not lead to major lineage expansion despite early appearance, nor is it critical to a well defined RNA secondary structure (highly entropic by all extant predictors).<br/> PG: Presumably the homoplasy is due to propensity of this site to deamination rather than a fitness advantage.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104351" class="lit_link">Van Dorp et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> PG: Effect is for reported homoplasy g.G11083T.<br/> PG: This variant has appeared independently many times in the tree, and lead to multiple extended lineages. <br/> PG: G->T is not easily explained by base deamination or cross-linking artefacts.<br/> PG: Early in the pandemic this variant was often seen in association with ORF3a G251V, together defining clade "V", but this was likely a founder effect rather than a necessary co-evolution as this tandem variant occurence is not found in newer samples.<br/>Could significantly modify COVID-19 pathogenicity by altering the host autophagic lysosomal antiviral machinery.
