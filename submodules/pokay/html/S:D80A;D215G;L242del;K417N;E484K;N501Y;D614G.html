<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Anti-NTD CV1 mAb isolated from an early pandemic case was unable to neutralize either partial B.1.351 variant pseudovirus used (A701V or L242del).<br/>The neutralization potency of mAb CV30, which contacts K417 and N501 but not E484, was ~10-fold weaker toward both B.1.351 variants. The neutralization potency of anti-RBD mAb CV3-1 was 3-4-fold less potent against the B.1.351 variants, while anti-RBD mAb CV2-75 was modestly less effective.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9175" class="lit_link">Stamatatos et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In an Ontario long term care facility, cumulatively, weaker BNT162b2 vaccine stimulation, age/comorbidities, produced a âˆ¼130-fold reduction  in apparent neutralization titers in mean 88yo LTCH residents against Beta (B.1.351), relative to staff vaccinees against D614G wild type. <br/> 37.9% of 116 two-dose-mRNA-vaccinated residents had undetectable neutralizing antibodies to B.1.351. mRNA-1273 vaccinee sera displayed ~2 better neutralization than BNT162b2. [common defining B.1.351 mutations noted, as the manuscript does not provide details] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261721" class="lit_link">Abe et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Pseudotyped viruses for B.1.351 was 3.4-fold resistant to neutralization by 6 BNT162b2 vaccine sera 28 days post-booster compared to wild type.<br/>Neutralization by 3 Moderna vaccine sera 28 days post-booster was 2.2-fold resistant.

Detectable antibodies against B.1.351 at various time points using ACE2 blocking assay in Moderna vaccinee cohort: Day 29 63%, Day 43 100%, Day 119 71%, Day 209 79%.<br/>Decreased neutralization on some assays was seen especially in those vaccinees tested that were 71+.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In sera collected from 15 early pandemic patients (Seattle Flu Study), mean 16 days post first dose with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines,  the median ID50 titers were ~10-fold lower against this B.1.351 pseudotyped virus relative to wild type. A single asymptomatic patient, who had no detectable RBD-specific IgG memory before vaccination, also did not elicit nAbs against the B.1.351 variant. [compare to ~3 fold without the deletion] ID50 titres in non-infected mRNA vaccines more than two weeks post-booster were significant, but ~500x weaker than in previously infected patients  after first dose.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9175" class="lit_link">Stamatatos et al.
