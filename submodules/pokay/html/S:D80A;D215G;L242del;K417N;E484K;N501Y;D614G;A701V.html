<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In a prospective study of 107 hospitalized patients, decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming  negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the  ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months (last of two samples taken)  in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was however observed for the B.1.351 variant.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab308" class="lit_link">Betton et al. (2020)</a>)</span></li>

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> On average across 7 European countries studied, using B.1.351 defining mutations:.<br/>Significant shift to infection in those without pre-existing conditions (79.6% vs 89% for non-VOC cases). Significant increase in hospitalization rate (19.3% vs 7.5% for non-VOC cases).<br/>Significant increase in ICU rate (2.3% vs 0.6% for non-VOC cases).

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> ELISpot assays show T cell neutralization reduced by 29.8% in this B.1.351 pseudotype relative to wild type in 18-20 pooled patient samples post second mRNA vaccine dose, with no significant difference between Pfizer and Moderna cohorts. Reduction was stronger in the S1 subunit than S2 (separate peptide pools were used).<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.442455" class="lit_link">Gallagher et al.

This was significant by ANOVA.<br/>Notably, 36.7% (11/30) recipients of two-dose Pfizer and 42.9% (15/35) recipients of two-dose Moderna vaccines did not have  detectable neutralization of at least one of the B.1.351 variants. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.013" class="lit_link">Garcia-Beltran et al.
