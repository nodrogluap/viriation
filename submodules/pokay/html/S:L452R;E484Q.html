<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Nine stored sera from Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccinees were tested against a range of spike mutation bearing PV. E484Q had a ~5x drop in neutralization (vs ~10x for E484K). When E484Q and L452R were combined, the fold change was significant, but similar to that of L452R alone (~2x), suggesting no evidence for an additive effect [perhaps even E484Q effect dilution]. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.443253" class="lit_link">Ferreira et al.
