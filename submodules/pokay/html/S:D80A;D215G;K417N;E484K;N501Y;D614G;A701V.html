<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Anti-NTD CV1 mAb isolated from an early pandemic case was unable to neutralize either partial B.1.351 variant pseudovirus used (A701V or L242del).<br/>The neutralization potency of mAb CV30, which contacts K417 and N501 but not E484, was ~10-fold weaker toward both B.1.351 variants. The neutralization potency of anti-RBD mAb CV3-1 was 3-4-fold less potent against the B.1.351 variants, while anti-RBD mAb CV2-75 was modestly less effective.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9175" class="lit_link">Stamatatos et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In sera collected from 15 early pandemic patients (Seattle Flu Study), mean 16 days post first dose with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines,  the median ID50 titers were ~3-fold lower against this B.1.351 pseudotyped virus relative to wild type. A single asymptomatic patient, who had no detectable RBD-specific IgG memory before vaccination, also did not elicit nAbs against the B.1.351 variant. [compare to ~10 fold with L242del] ID50 titres in non-infected mRNA vaccines more than two weeks post-booster were signficiant, but >100x weaker than in previously infected  patients after first dose.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9175" class="lit_link">Stamatatos et al.
