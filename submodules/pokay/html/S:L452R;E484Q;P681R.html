<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Gross examination of 3+3 hamster lung specimens showed pronounced congestion and hemorrhages on days 5 and 7 post-infection in the case of the B.1.617.1 as compared with the B.1. The lung lesions with  the B.1 variant were minimal to mild whereas with B.1.617.1 they were moderate. For B.1 pneumonic changes were minimal to mild (inflammatory cell infiltration, focal consolidation and mild congestion). The pronounced changes (moderate to severe) with mononuclear infiltration in the alveolar interstitial space, interstitial septal thickening, consolidation and pneumocyte hyperplasia were observed with B.1.617.1 variant consistently.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.442760" class="lit_link">Yadav et al.
