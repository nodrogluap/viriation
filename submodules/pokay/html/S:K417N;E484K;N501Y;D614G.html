<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Assuming complete cross-protection, we estimate 501Y.V2/B.1.351 was 1.50 (95% CrI: 1.20-2.13) times as transmissible than previously circulating variants. Assuming instead that 501Y.V2 is identically transmissible, the new variant evades 21% (95% CrI: 11-36%) of previously acquired immunity. Reality may lie between these extremes, with an intermediate increase in transmissibility and mildly imperfect cross-protection from past exposure. <br/> (<a href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/reports/sa-novel-variant/2021_01_11_Transmissibility_and_severity_of_501Y_V2_in_SA.pdf" class="lit_link">Pearson et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> 36,590 variant-specific RT-PCR tests were performed on samples collected between April 12 and May 7, 2021  in France to compare variant spread. Compared to January to March 2021, B.1.351 variant had a significant  transmission advantage over B.1.1.7 in some regions (15.1 to 16.1% in Île-de-France and 16.1 to 18.8% in Hauts-de-France).<br/>This shift in transmission advantage is consistent with the immune evasion abilities of B.1.351 and the high levels of immunization in these regions.

A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1  nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.<br/>Serum samples obtained from 13 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients without SARS-CoV-2 infection through 41 days after vaccination  showed 3.5x reduction in neutralization (ID50) for B.1.351 RBD pseudotype HIB-1 virus compared to D614G alone. This  RBD variant combination's neutralization by a placebo control  group of 6 naturally infected patients showed a similar 3.2x drop (though with D614G starting at a 1.7x higher titre than vaccinee sera).<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2102214" class="lit_link">Madhi et al.
