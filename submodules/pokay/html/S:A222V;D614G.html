Both cases were mild.<br/>No significant differences in the neutralizing capacity of the two lineages were observed in 4 sera taken (1 pre-reinfection,  three post-reinfection). Neutralizing antibody titres (IC50) before and immediately after re-infection were <300 against  both strains, and jumped >7x upon re-infection. Viral titres were also higher in the second case.<br/>Second case also includes N:p.A220V (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040661" class="lit_link">Brehm et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
