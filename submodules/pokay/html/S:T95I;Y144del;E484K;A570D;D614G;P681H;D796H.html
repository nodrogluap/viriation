Symptoms resolved over a one week period.<br/>Serum obtained 4 days after symptom onset was tested for neutralization against wild-type  virus, the E484K mutant, and the B.1.526 variant. It was equally effective against each.<br/>These data suggest that the antibody response recognized these variants but was nonetheless insufficient to prevent a  breakthrough infection.<br/>The virus detected matched neither B.1.1.7 nor B.1.526 VOC strains in wide circulation in New York at the time of infection, though shared some mutations.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2105000" class="lit_link">Hacisuleyman et al.
