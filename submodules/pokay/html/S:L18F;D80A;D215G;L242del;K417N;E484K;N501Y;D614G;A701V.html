<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Flow cytometry was used on recombinant VSV proteins and yeast surface display to assess the binding of a labeled soluble ACE2  protein to cells expressing B.1.351. We observed an increase (relative to D614G) in binding of soluble  ACE2 to B.1.351, and to a much gearter extent to B.1.1.7, which both carry the N501Y mutation (see Fig 3). <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01318-5" class="lit_link">Planas et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Encouragingly, we find that the majority of T cell responses in recipients of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine are generated  by epitopes that are invariant between the [wildtype] and two of the current variants of concern (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351).<br/>In over 90% of two dose mRNA vaccinees, heterotypic neutralizing titres (NT50) against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 remain comfortably  above the level associated with immune protection in recent vaccine trials. However, in over 50% of convalescent COVID-19  individuals and recipients of a only a single dose of mRNA vaccine – heterotypic neutralization dropped to negligible levels,  particularly against B.1.351.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-226857/v1" class="lit_link">Skelly et al.

Insufficient numbers reaching the primary study endpoint were available in that arm of the vaccine study to report any statistics from the South African participants. Additionally, the study period of the paper ended in November 2020, while the earliest reported case of this lineage is October (covariants.org), only becoming dominant by mid-November.] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1" class="lit_link">Voysey et al.

This was significant by ANOVA.<br/>Notably, 36.7% (11/30) recipients of two-dose Pfizer and 42.9% (15/35) recipients of two-dose Moderna vaccines did not have  detectable neutralization of at least one of the B.1.351 variants. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.013" class="lit_link">Garcia-Beltran et al.
