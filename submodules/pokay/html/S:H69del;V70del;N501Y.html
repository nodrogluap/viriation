Luciferase activity was measured two days postinfection,  showing significant (40%) increase in infection rate amongst the cells, much more than the effect of  either the deletion or the point mutation alone, suggetsing that this combination has a synergistic effect  contributing to cell entry fitness, moreso than this combination with the addition of P681H.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.430003" class="lit_link">Tada et al.
