<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In 3 of 11 subjects' convalescent sera in an early+late mutational landscape analysis of the RBD,  E484P shows a resistant profile, but was mostly reduce or eliminated by   later time points (i.e. generally less resistant to immune cell somatic mutation evolution than E484Q of E484K), see Figure 5a,b.<br/>Subject C 32 days post-infection showed >>10 fold reduction in neutralization, reducing to ~10-fold by day 104. Subject B 26 days post-infection showed ~10 fold reduction in neutralization, but little immune escape at day 113.<br/>Subject G 18 days post-infection showed ~7 fold reduction in neutralization, but no immune escape at day 94. Notably, Subject G had no E484K/Q effect at either the early or late timepoints.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.02.003" class="lit_link">Greaney et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
