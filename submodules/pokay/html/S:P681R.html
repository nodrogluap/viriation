<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> This mutation in the first base of the furin clevage site maintains the RXXR recognition motif, and is presumed to enhance cleavage based on the removal of a proline-directed phosphotase recognition site at S680. In a homologuous site in Infectious .<br/>Bronchitis Virus (IBV, Gammacoronaviruses), abolition of S680 phosphorylation improves furin cleavage  (and presumably cell entry).
