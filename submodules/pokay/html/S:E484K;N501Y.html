<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In the case of VOC B.1.1.7+E484K, the addition of the E484K mutation to N501Y further increased the affinity, to ~15 fold higher than WT RBD (KD ~5 nM), by further increasing the k(on) as measured by surface plasmon resonance. Because the higher k(on) could result in mass transfer limiting binding, we confirmed that the kinetic measurement for this variant was not substantially affected by varying levels of immobilization.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444646" class="lit_link">Barton et al.
