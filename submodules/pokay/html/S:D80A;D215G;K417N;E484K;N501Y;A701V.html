<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Hamsters re-infected with B.1.351 virus after seroversion from previous infection with a lineage A virus did not transmit  virus to naive sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. They had little  infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs.<br/>Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351, but prevents disease and onward transmission.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> 4 health care workers in the 20's and 30's with no underlying conditions and seropositivity or confirmed 2020 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed to have B.1.351 infection during a Februrary 2021 hospital outbreak in Luxembourg. Symptoms were mostly mild on first infection, and milder on second infection.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.18.2100423" class="lit_link">Staub et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Inoculation with the B.1.351 isolate resulted in lower clinical scores in 6 rhesus macaques that correlated with lower virus  titers in the lungs, less severe histologic lung lesions and less viral antigen detected in the lungs. Our comparative  pathogenicity study suggests that ongoing circulation under diverse evolutionary pressure favors transmissibility and  immune evasion rather than an increase in intrinsic pathogenicity.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443115" class="lit_link">Munster et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Using B.1.351 defining mutations for Spike, observed 4x average decrease in neutralization efficiency  (but still relevant titres) for sera from 10 BNT162b2 vaccinees 12 days after second dose, but only one  relevant titre 12 days after first dose. Compares unfavorably to wild type or B.1.1.7 titres.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.22.441007" class="lit_link">Alenquer et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
