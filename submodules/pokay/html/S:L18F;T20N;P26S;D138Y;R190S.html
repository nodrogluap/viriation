<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The neutralization titer of NTD-binding mAb159 was 133-fold reduced on P.1 compared to Victoria (~wild type), with only 64% neutralization at 10 μg/mL.<br/>Residues 20, 18, and 138 form a cluster underlying the 245–259 loop, which inserts into a groove between the light and heavy chains of Fab 159. In addition, the N-terminal residues preceding residue 18 interact with the antibody and may be perturbed.<br/>Given that there is likely a single supersite ("i") for potent NTD-binding antibodies, the binding of many of these are likely affected. Using 20 potent (primaruly anti-RBD) antibodies, neutralization was measured by a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and compared with  neutralization of Victoria (~wild type) and variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Compared to Victoria neutralization by the mAbs was significantly impacted by P.1,  with 12/20 showing > 10-fold reduction in FRNT50 titer and a number showing complete knockout of activity. The results with P.1 showed a  greater impact compared to B.1.1.7 but were, as expected, similar to those with B.1.351.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.055" class="lit_link">Dejnirattisai et al.
