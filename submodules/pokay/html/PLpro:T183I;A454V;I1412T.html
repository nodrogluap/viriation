<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Relative to Germany/BavPat1/2020 (early B lineage), 8 to 122-fold IFN-I response resistance was observed (as measured by 17 IFNs)  for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.<br/>The B.1.1.7 strain exhibiting the highest IFN-I resistance at 122-fold (compare to 8x for B.1.351, 17x for B.1). The level of B.1.1.7 interferon  resistance was more striking when compared to USA-WA1/2020 (322-fold). <br/> [changes noted as 112x in figure, 122x in text. Addition of A1305V from UK B.1.1.7 replicate has minimal effect. Replication  effects and IFN resistence cannot be readily distinguished in the assays used. Effect of lineage mutations in other genes may be important as well/instead] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.20.436257" class="lit_link">Guo et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
