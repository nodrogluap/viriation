<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The nasal mucosa of Pfizer vaccinees with time course collection was evaluated against VSV pseudotypes: results (only one nasal  swab from different previously infected vacinee neutralizing at weeks 3 and 6 against B.1.1.7 and D614G) suggest that vaccinees probably  do not elicit an early humoral response detectable at mucosal surfaces even though sera neutralization was observed. They strengthen the hypothesis that some vaccines may not protect against  viral acquisition and infection of the oral–nasal region, but may prevent severe disease associated with viral dissemination in the lower respiratory tract. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01318-5" class="lit_link">Planas et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than wild type (~9-fold).<br/>This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.  D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may  increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19808-4" class="lit_link">Zhang et l.

This was an average of a 2-fold increase, relative to sera drawn from the  individuals who received one dose of vaccination—mean NT50 dilution of 51,300. Importantly, a 6-fold increase in mean NT50 dilution was  obtained when sera from the first vaccination dose was compared to convalescent sera from cohort with severe disease (NT50 51,000 vs 8,700)  21 to 63 days post-onset. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.03.008" class="lit_link">Kuzmina et al.
