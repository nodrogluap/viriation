<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The estimated vaccine effectiveness against R.1 strain SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents in a Kentucky skilled nursing facility was  66.2% (95% CI = 40.5%–80.8%) and among health care workers was 75.9% (95% CI = 32.5%–91.4%) in the cohort of only those  14d+ post-vaccination Pfizer booster dose. VE against symptomatic COVID-19 was 86.5% (95% CI = 65.6%–94.7%) among residents  and 87.1% (95% CI = 46.4%–96.9%) among HCP. VE against hospitalization was 94.4% (95% CI = 73.9%–98.8%) among residents;  no HCP were hospitalized. Three residents died, two of whom were unvaccinated (VE = 94.4%; 95% CI = 44.6%–99.4%).<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7017e2" class="lit_link">Cavanaugh et al.
