<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The N501Y mutation had the biggest effect on ACE2 affinity of any VOC mutation tested, increasing the affinity ~10 fold to KD ~7 nM, by increasing the k(on) ~1.8 fold and decreasing the k(off) by ~ 7 fold as measured by surface plasmon resonance. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444646" class="lit_link">Barton et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In silico methods (PyMOL and PDBePISA) involving mutagenesis (N501Y mutation) and interface analysis focusing on the Spike  RDB-ACE2 interaction showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutant (lineage B.1.1.7) establishes a more significant number of  interactions relating to the mutant residue Y501 (Spike RDB) with residues Y41 and K353 (ACE2). This finding shows that the  increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501  mutant residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.29.424708" class="lit_link">Santos and Passos (2021)</a>)</span></li>
