<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In a escape mutation generation experiment using protease inhibitor boceprevir, all four independent experiments revealed this mutation combination. Two of the samples had up to 4.7x resistance to boceprevir as measured by EC50 in Vero E6 cells.<br/>This resistence was NOT recapitulated in a subsequent confirmatory bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone experiment.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In a escape mutation generation experiment using protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, samples previously escaping boceprevir with this  mutation combination had up to 6.8x resistance to nirmatrelvir as measured by EC50 in Vero E6 cells.<br/>This resistence was NOT recapitulated in a subsequent confirmatory bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone experiment. Remdesivir effectiveness was not significantly affected by this mutation combination, suggesting that ciombined treatment would be less likely to induce resistance.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.06.494921" class="lit_link">Zhou et al.
