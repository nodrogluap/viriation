<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In Qatar, where Pfizer vaccine use is prevalent (<10% of the population covered in the time period of the study ending Mar 31, 2021), any time after one dose  (including the 2 weeks where no major effect is expected) B.1.1.7 lineage effectiveness was observed as 29.5% (95% CI [22.9,35.5]) against infection, and 54.1% against severe/critical/fatal disease  (95% CI [26.1-71.9]). Two weeks or more after 2nd dose, effectiveness climbed to 89.5% [85.9,92.3] against infection, and 100% against  severe/critical/fatal disease (95% CI [81.7,100]).<br/>All vaccinees were on a strict 3 week interval for second dose (https://twitter.com/supermarioelia/status/1390362358971781122), therefore 1st dose efficacy is likely underestimated.
