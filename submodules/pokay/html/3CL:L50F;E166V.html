<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In a escape mutation generation experiment using protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, one of two independent experiments generated this mutation combination. It provides 175x resistance to nirmatrelvir as measured by EC50 in Vero E6 cells.<br/>The significance of these putative resistance substitutions was confirmed by reverse genetics using a bacterial artificial  chromosome (BAC) clone, which displayed ~80x resistance.<br/>Remdesivir effectiveness was not significantly affected by this mutation combination, suggesting that ciombined treatment would be less likely to induce resistance.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.06.494921" class="lit_link">Zhou et al.
