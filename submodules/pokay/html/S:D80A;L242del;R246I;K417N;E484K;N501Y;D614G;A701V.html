<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Most of the plasma from 55 Pfizer vaccinees developed high percentages of Wuhan-Hu-1 S-ACE2 blocking activity, peaking at day 28 (7 days post-boost). <br/> A strikingly consistent hierarchy of reduction in plasma antibody binding by variant S and RBD antigens was observed among study  participants, with progressively decreased binding for B.1.1.7 (not significant), P.1 (significant) and B.1.351 (significant) compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254952" class="lit_link">Röltgen et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The neutralization activities of two vaccines developed in China were tested against 501Y.V2 authentic virus: inactivated BBIBP-CorV (no  significant change) and recombinant dimeric RBD vaccine ZF2001 (~1.6x reduction vs wildtype, p=0.04). Both vaccines largely  preserved their neutralizing titres.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.429069" class="lit_link">Huang et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In sera 1-2 weeks after BNT162b2 first dose, from six patients previously infected with B.1, antibody titer in a microneutralization assay  was on average 1625 for B.1.351 virus.<br/>This compares favorably (stronger) to most post-infection neutralization titer against all variants tested in the same sera (wild type, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1).

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Study 3001 on Ad26.COV2.S (Jannsen vaccine) conducted September 21, 2020 through January 22, 2021 overlaps the emergence and dominance  of the B.1.351 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa. The SA arms of the Phase 3 double blind study showed severe/critical disease VE of 73.1%  (95% CI: 40.0-89.4), and moderate to severe/critical disease VE of 52.0% (95% CI: 30.3-67.4). Compare to 78.0% and 74.4% for North American arm of the study during the same period (with low B.1.351 prevalence). Of the 66.9% of SA severe infections that have been sequenced as of this report, 94.5% are B.1.351.<br/> (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download" class="lit_link">Janssen Biotech (2021)</a>)</span></li>
<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> The dominant circulating B.1.351 spike variant originating in RSA, which harbors E484K and additional substitutions in the  RBD, NTD, and S2 and deletions in the NTD (amino acids 242–244), was neutralized with a 5.02-fold reduced titer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202756" class="lit_link">Solfrosi et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 in a nursing home, all non-vaccinated residents (5/5) versus  half of those fully vaccinated 2-5 weeks prior with BNT162b2 (13/26) were infected. Two of 13 vaccinated versus 4 of 5  non-vaccinated residents presented severe disease. BNT162b2 did not prevent the outbreak, but reduced  transmission and disease severity. Among the 13 fully vaccinated residents who were infected, 2 (15.4%) presented with an asymptomatic disease, 9 (69.2%) developed mild to moderate symptoms, and 2 (15.4%) progressed to severe disease with fatal evolution secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There was no relationship between anti-S antibody levels at diagnosis and disease severity.<br/>Overall, the proportion of residents with severe disease in the non-vaccinated group (4/5)  was higher than that in the vaccinated group (2/13). Only 1 vaccinated staff, but 10 unvaccinated were infected in the outbreak (no severe disease).<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab446" class="lit_link">Bailly et al.

<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> Pseudotyped B.1.351 v3 virus has reduced neutralization activity vs wild type: 42.4x (30 sera Pfizer median 9 days post 2nd dose)  and 19.2x (35 sera Moderna median 18 days post 2nd dose). This was significant by ANOVA.<br/>Notably, 36.7% (11/30) recipients of two-dose Pfizer and 42.9% (15/35) recipients of two-dose Moderna vaccines did not have  detectable neutralization of at least one of the B.1.351 variants. <br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.013" class="lit_link">Garcia-Beltran et al.
