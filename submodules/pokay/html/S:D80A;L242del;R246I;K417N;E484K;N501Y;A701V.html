<li class="lit_item"><span class="lit_summary"> In Qatar, where Pfizer vaccine use is prevalent (<10% of the population covered in the time period of the study ending Mar 31, 2021), any time after one dose  (including the 2 weeks where no major effect is expected) B.1.351 lineage effectiveness was observed as 16.9% (95% CI [10.4,23.0]) against infection, and 0% against severe/critical/fatal disease  (95% CI [0-19.0]). Two weeks or more after 2nd dose, effectiveness climbed to 75.0% [70.5,78.9] against infection, and 100% against  severe/critical/fatal disease (95% CI [73.7,100]).<br/>All vaccinees were on a strict 3 week interval for second dose (https://twitter.com/supermarioelia/status/1390362358971781122), therefore 1st dose efficacy is likely underestimated.

By comparison, HCW receiving one vaccine dose without prior  infection showed reduced immunity against variants. B.1.351 spike mutations  resulted in increased, abrogated or unchanged T cell responses depending on human leukocyte  antigen (HLA) polymorphisms. Study was 26 each post-infection and post first dose HCWs.<br/> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abh1282" class="lit_link">Reynolds et al. (2021)</a>)</span></li>
